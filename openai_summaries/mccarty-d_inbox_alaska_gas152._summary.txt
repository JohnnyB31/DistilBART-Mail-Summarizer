The emails discuss a draft Confidentiality Agreement (CA) related to the Bullet Pipeline project to Chicago, involving Enron, TransCanada, and El Paso. The CA requires all parties' approval for a press release, which is targeted for mid-December. TransCanada suggests covering all relevant entities, including El Paso's corporate entity rather than just ANR. The first draft of the joint development agreement is expected late Wednesday, with review available by Friday morning.
