Mike prefers not to lock in curves before the JM Huber deal is officially signed and suggests establishing a sharing policy to avoid risks if the deal falls through. Barry confirms the curves are agreed upon and will sit on the books until next week, with the deal effectively completed. If the deal does not close, the MTM risks will revert to the original desk, and any positive or negative curve shifts will be credited accordingly. The teams will work on sharing calculations and set up structures next week.
