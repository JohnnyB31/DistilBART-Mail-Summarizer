The NYISO requires us to replace our Letter of Guarantee by the end of this week due to a credit rating downgrade. Our current credit commitments are $1.5 million total, split between Energy and ICAP. Juan discussed this with NYISO's Credit Department, who advised us to contact our credit team for details. We need to stay on top of this issue because our credit obligations will increase as our physical load grows.
