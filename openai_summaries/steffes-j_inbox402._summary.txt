The email thread discusses BGE's collateral requirements, with multiple parties involved. Enron has been contacted by several utilities (Socal, NIMO, BGE) for collateral. A BGE message states that no future enrollments (DRS and daily metered) can be processed until additional collateral is provided, and questions about collateral requests are raised. Harry Kingerski offers to follow up and knows Mark Valvanis. There is also a request to forward the excerpt to the appropriate party, and a question about who should handle the collateral issue.
