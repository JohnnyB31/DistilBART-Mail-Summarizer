The lawsuit was filed, and the team is working to get MSN formally served by issuing a citation and serving papers on MSN's registered agent in Austin. They aim to complete this process quickly, hopefully by the end of the day, and have instructed not to mention the lawsuit to MSN until formal service is done. Updates will be provided as negotiations continue.
