The team is gathering data requirements for NEWCO, focusing on common data including Gas/Power commercial and trading support data. Mike Croucher is coordinating the effort and will visit the trading floors to gather information. He requests a list of individuals from each business unit to assist with the data migration, which is scheduled to be completed quickly due to the large volume of data. Bob Hall emphasizes that no deal or counterparty data can be transferred to NETCO and asks for more details before assigning tasks.
