Sara is coordinating with Sibyl Peyer regarding a new account agreement involving ERMT Corp. Sibyl has questions about the source of funds, why the trade is out of this entity instead of Enron, and whether ERMT is a regulated entity. She requests a copy of ERMT's Certificate of Incorporation and additional activity details. Sara offers to duplicate Enron Corp. documents if needed. The discussion includes inquiries about ERMT's status and documentation, with no specific dates or meeting times mentioned.
