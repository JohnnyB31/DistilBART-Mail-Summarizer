Julie Armstrong reports that the TV monitor is still not functioning and the current large TV and stand are problematic, protruding in the walkway. She questions whether the cable is functioning and requests advice on resolving the issue promptly. She notes that someone was supposed to check the monitor on Thursday, but she did not see anyone before leaving the office at 5:20, and she was out of the office on Friday.
