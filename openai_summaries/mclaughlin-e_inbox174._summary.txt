Kam Keiser reports that Jeff successfully created a Netco file for each region without an erequest. Kam asks team members to select a P&L file from their region as a backup and lists the known files, including Exotica, Hedgestrips, and Curve files. Kam suggests adding the position report file created by Jad/Couch as a backup to the CEPos/East Positions and requests Couch to include the query file for the price desk.
