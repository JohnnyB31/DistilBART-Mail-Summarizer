Julia Murray and her team are analyzing Citi and Bank of America prepays, focusing on outstanding amounts and related agreements. They confirmed there are no outstanding prepays with Citibank and no monies on deposit with Chase. A downgrade by S&P below investment grade would reduce the collateral threshold under the margin agreement from $10 million to zero, but there is no Moody's downgrade trigger. Julia and her colleagues are consolidating all relevant information this afternoon.
