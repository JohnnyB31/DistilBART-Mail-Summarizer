Kimberly Watson sent an email about the Questar Southern Trails interconnect agreement, asking recipients to review the attached document and provide comments. Teb Lokey noted a correction in the "Notices" section, referencing "Market Services" instead of "Gas Logistics." Kimberly plans to send a draft to Questar on January 22 and requests replies with comments.
