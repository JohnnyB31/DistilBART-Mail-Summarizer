The email discusses facilitating sleeves/bookouts trades, with some traders unwilling to participate without spreads and others refusing to discuss. There are pending opportunities in PJM and ERCOT, and a potential new 4-year deal in the west is being reviewed, which could increase credit exposure. The sender asks the recipient to speak with Presto about trades and to help with the PJM and ERCOT opportunities.
