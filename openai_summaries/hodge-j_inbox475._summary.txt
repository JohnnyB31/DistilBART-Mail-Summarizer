The team discussed negotiating a Master Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement with J Aron for US and Canada gas trading. J Aron inquired about their willingness to enter into such an agreement and suggested replacing GTCs with a GISB. Currently, they trade under GTCs and prefer working under them until a master agreement is finalized. They are willing to proceed with a master agreement if they receive credit information, but are not willing to use GISB at this time. There is no existing master agreement with J Aron, possibly due to lack of focus in the past.
