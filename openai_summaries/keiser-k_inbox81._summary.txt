Shona Wilson provided an updated template for the terminated vs non-terminated deals, with all books split into three categories. She requested that Form B be prepared for all commodities as of 1/31/02, and asked when the schedule could be ready, including a reconciliation to their rolls. The updated template and the E&Y request file were attached.
