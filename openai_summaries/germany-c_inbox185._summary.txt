The email discusses the possibility of releasing capacity from contract 29667 in four separate pieces, with consideration of doing permanent releases. It is confirmed that the capacity cannot be permanently released because it results from an assignment from Boston Gas. The contract is a capacity release contract and does not have an evergreen clause.
