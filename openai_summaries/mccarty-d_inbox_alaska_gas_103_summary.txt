The team agreed to submit the producer proposal with two small edits: changing "The Pipeline" to "Receipt/Delivery Points" and "Toll" to "Illustrative Toll." They are working on a draft and plan to review and revise it before sharing it with the larger group. A reconvening meeting is scheduled for Monday afternoon.
