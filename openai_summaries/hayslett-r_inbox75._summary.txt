The email thread discusses the valuation of a company, with Thomas stating the company did not agree to the $41.9MM value but accepted an earlier valuation of $26.5MM, and suggesting an increase of $2.0MM instead of $3.2MM. James Saunders mentions that there is an agreement to the $41.9MM value and asks for revisions to the management representation letter. Stephen Huzar notes he has to leave for a 1 pm meeting, mentions the need to get a management rep after the financials are refiled, and asks Jim to review the attached document "Mgmt Rep Update EGP 8K2.doc" which contains new and verified text for the SEC filings.
