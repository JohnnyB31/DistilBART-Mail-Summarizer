Louise reports that the DASH for the Napoleonville Land sale was only available at 4pm on Wednesday, with no prior circulation or briefing, making it difficult to review. Jean Mrha is flying to Buffalo for Thanksgiving and has arranged for Julie Gomez to sign on his behalf for the sale. The land is currently in a bidding war, with Texas Brine having offered $2.35MM and a new bid of $3MM from another party. Reliant is delaying the transaction due to legal review. Jean expects the land will be sold and aims to close before leaving.
