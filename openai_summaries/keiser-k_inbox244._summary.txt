Russ is gathering lists of people needing Netco Sitara access for East and Central regions. Security access for "Estate" will remain the same as current production, but "Netco" access must be set up from scratch for regional groups including Risk, Logistics, and Trading. The plan is to create a large access setup under the new application region code "Houston - Netco," with updates handled via eRequest.
