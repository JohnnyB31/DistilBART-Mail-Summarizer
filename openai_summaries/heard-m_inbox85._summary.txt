Robbi reports that Mary Nell was denied returning to Houston and that the office is in trouble with staff on emergency projects. Robbi is working on placing orders with Schumacher and Kravet, which are in stock and priced lower than expected, with freight and taxes to be added. Robbi will inform Marie once the exact amounts are known and asks if she should proceed with the orders. Robbi is also working on an application for Robert Allen, aiming to complete it by Friday.
