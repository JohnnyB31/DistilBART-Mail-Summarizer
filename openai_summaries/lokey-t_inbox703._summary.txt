The parties are discussing capacity leases related to Gulfstream, with the Commission having no problem with capacity leases now, provided they do not harm existing customers. Gulfstream has inquired about a backhaul capacity lease for a potential Phase VII expansion project, involving about 20-30 miles, and whether such a lease would trigger the FP&L Favored Nations Clause if used to deliver to an electric generator. They plan to discuss the commercial aspects and opportunities of the lease.
