Phillip asked the team to coordinate someone to listen to the weekly Western Wholesale Activities conference call, which Tara from the fundamental group was recording. Jim responded with a privileged and confidential update on Western wholesale matters and suggested forwarding updates to interested team members. An upcoming conference call is scheduled every Thursday at 1:00 pm Pacific, 3:00 pm Central, and 4:00 pm Eastern, with details and a table of ongoing FERC issues attached. The agenda includes discussions on FERC market monitoring and subpoenas related to SoCal Edison. Jim will not participate in the next call due to attending a Senate hearing.
