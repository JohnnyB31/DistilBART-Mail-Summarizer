Enron announced a positive development involving a $1 billion secured credit line with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney, supported by Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern Pipeline, to improve liquidity and confidence. The pipelines are not being sold and the funds will be used to refinance obligations. Additional $200 million credit capacity is available. Enron also has $3 billion in credit lines from last week. Lucy appreciates the updates and encourages reading the recent editorial and intranet transcripts.
