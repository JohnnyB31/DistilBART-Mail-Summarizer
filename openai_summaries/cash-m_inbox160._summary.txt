The extension of Frank Stabler's separation agreement from 12/01/01 to 12/31/01 was requested due to his support on a divestiture. Shelly Pierce coordinated the process, confirming the signed amendment was received and asking if it should go to the Cash Management Committee for approval. Michelle Cash indicated it would be handled without issue, and Jeff Donahue supported the extension. David Oxley suggested checking with lawyers, but agreed that if Jeff and Jeff M support it, the extension should proceed. Shelly was asked to generate a second amendment if approved.
