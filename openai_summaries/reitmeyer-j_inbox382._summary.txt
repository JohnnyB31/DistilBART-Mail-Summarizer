The email discusses restrictions on gas deliveries by PSCo on November 3-4 due to warm weather and operational issues. PSCo cannot accept imbalance payback gas or over-deliveries, which will be cut to zero if they occur. Plant operators are instructed to restrict deliveries to confirmed nominations only, and shippers should not nominate imbalance payback during this period.
