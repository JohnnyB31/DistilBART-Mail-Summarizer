Gerald and Chris discussed updating a confidentiality agreement to include legal language covering oral discussions. Gerald noted that excluding oral information from confidentiality could cause issues. Chris asked Gerald to prepare executable copies for signing and sending to Ormat. Hank reviewed the agreement, made a change requiring Enron to identify and mark confidential information sent to Ormat, and confirmed the agreement looked okay. Chris planned to call Hank early next week to discuss a potential deal.
