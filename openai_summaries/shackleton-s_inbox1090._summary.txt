The email thread discusses verifying if Enron Corp guarantees have been provided for brokerage accounts, specifically for ECT Europe Finance, Inc., and whether the guarantee for Enron Credit Inc. will be terminated. Sara Shackleton reports a call from Bear Stearns about the guarantee and asks about approval and account status. Tom Doukas mentions that Mark Wilson is no longer the contact and is trying to find a new credit approval contact. Tom also indicates the need to amend the Bear guaranty to include ECT Europe Finance, which would free up $2.5 million in cash. Tom left a voicemail requesting this amendment and asks about the approval process and turnaround time.
