Kristin sent an attached draft of the PGE limits document to Stan Horton and others, noting that Jim Lobdell is awaiting approval on certain items. She also left Rick Buy off the cc list initially and wanted to ensure he saw the draft. The document was discussed at PGE's September 6th Risk Management Committee meeting, and Kristin forwarded it before a Monday conference call regarding PGE Risk Management.
