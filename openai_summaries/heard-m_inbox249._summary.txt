Robbi and Marie arranged a meeting at 11:30 downstairs with Jane. Robbi informed Marie that Robert Allen will send a return slip for 7 yards of material, which was ordered incorrectly by the Houston showroom. Robert has a 17-yard piece in stock, and Marie should watch for the return label in the mail.
