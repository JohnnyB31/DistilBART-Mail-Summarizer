James Hungerford requested advice from John Hodge regarding a confirmation deal. Dick Bryan sent a memo via fax to Hungerford, John Hodge, and himself, highlighting two items missing from the confirmation. Bryan emailed the memo to Hungerford and Hodge, indicating it was faxed earlier. The key issue is that the attached confirmation and memo clarify deal details, with Bryan unsure who is responsible for documenting those understandings.
