Kelly Lombardi coordinated the setup of rate server handle #27470 for PSCO.CITYGATE.GDP.D.A after Carole Frank requested it due to an invalid index issue with a deal involving the Gas Daily Published point "PSCo citygate." Kelly instructed George and Russ to bounce the servers and notify Frank so the deal can be attached. Carole needs the new pub_code sent to her and others, and Cecilia/Margie will map the pubcode in ERMS. Kelly emphasizes that the rate handle must be included on the validation report and attached to the deal in Sitara.
