The team is in the process of changing deal valuations for WestWing 230KV and 500KV to be based on the WestWing curve, due to legal reasons. An example deal suffered a $294K loss after the delivery point was changed on 10/5/01. The previous unfavorable curve shift has been corrected on 10/8/01. Fran requests that the mapping be changed so deals with these delivery points continue to be valued against the WestWing curve, and asks for the timeline on this change.
