Gerald and Art Avalos discussed revisions to Section 4.4 of the Master Firm Agreement. Art's lawyer suggested that offset, set off, or recoupment only apply between the Company and the Customer, excluding the Customer's PNM Gas Services division. Gerald agreed with the language, and they plan to prepare executables for signatures.
