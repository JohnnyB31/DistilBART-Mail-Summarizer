The email thread involves Margaret Daffin forwarding a memo about student travel and EAD start dates to Michelle Cash, requesting her to review and approve it. Alice Gruber from Tindall & Foster sent an updated memo, noting that it should be reviewed carefully to avoid discouraging students from choosing Enron, as this issue may be raised more frequently soon. Margaret has sent the attachment to Terry Bosien for review and is awaiting Michelle's advice.
