Geoff Pollard is trying to resolve a customer switch complaint involving Pac Tel. He placed a call to the customer at 7:30 this morning but has not heard back yet. Jim Steffes received a call from the CPUC about an unauthorized service switch by Pac Tel, involving Mike Benson. Jim asks who the client representative for Pac Tel is and requests that Jeff Dasovich be informed to follow up with Joyce at the CPUC. Jim will be out on vacation next week, and the team plans to call the CPUC back by Monday EOB.
