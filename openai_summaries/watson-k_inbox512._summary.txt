The outage report for the Albuquerque region shows that the overhauls on Station 4 units are scheduled to begin on April 1, 2002, instead of March 1, 2002, and will run through June 4, 2002. The units need to be operational by July 1, as July and August are tariff months. Donna Martens asks Jerry Graves to review the attached report and contact her with questions.
