Vince suggests increasing the number of factors and using historical log-returns to better capture the term-structure of correlations, which Frank supports. Frank emphasizes that Louise Kitchen wants this implementation as a top priority today, and discusses different methods for calculating correlations, including using log returns and heat rate. Bharat has run correlation analyses, and there is a file named "GAS PWR.xls" related to this work.
