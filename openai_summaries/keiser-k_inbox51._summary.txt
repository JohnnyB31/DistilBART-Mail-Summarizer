Tom informs Kam that he will soon have access to the EOL system, and Stephanie will send the IDs and passwords. The new production database is not for testing, and only a limited number of users are authorized to test and clean up data. Once the UBS production database is built, it will be copied to the test database, and testing will resume. Kam requests access for risk management to the EOL bridge monitor and reports by Thursday to prepare for testing.
