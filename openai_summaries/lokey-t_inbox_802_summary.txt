The email thread discusses ongoing checks into gas balances and imbalances, including a December imbalance of 211K due to estimated flow and a broken check meter. Sheila reports that Tim is following up with Tejas to verify actual flow data. Shelley expresses concern about the increasing supply imbalance (1.5 Bcf and 700 MMcf for the current month), noting balances were recently reduced but are now rising again, possibly due to Phase V outages. They are working on a process to tie out scheduled quantities and reconcile old imbalances, with some balances being used to cover FPL's imbalance during outages.
