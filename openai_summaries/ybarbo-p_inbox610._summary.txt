The email exchange involves Paul Y'Barbo requesting information about the NYMEX forward curve beyond 3 years and details about the basis curve "NGI - PGE/TOPOCK." Neeran Pathak responds that the forward curve is available beyond 3 years and offers to provide it. Neeran also explains that the basis curve "NGI - PGE/TOPOCK" is not currently held in positions and that the actual basis used by traders may be at PGE-City gate. The discussion includes technical details about the curves and mentions that someone in Structuring would be better suited to answer specific questions.
