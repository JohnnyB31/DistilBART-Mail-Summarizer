Gary Anderson indicated that Caroline Barnes suggested Lynn Blair has a Gas Logistics presentation. Lynn offered three possible dates and times in November (1st afternoon, 13th morning, 14th afternoon) for the presentation. Lynn asked Gary to give her a call and let her know if any of these dates work, and inquired if the presentation would be about 1 hour. Gary plans to arrange the conference room once the date is confirmed.
