The OCC has established two ongoing weekly conference calls: a Combined Safety and Environment call every Monday from 1:00 to 2:00 PM, and a Safety Only call starting December 4th every Tuesday from 1:30 to 2:30 PM. Participants are asked to share speaker phones due to limited ports. Sarita and Judy are requested to forward this information to their groups.
