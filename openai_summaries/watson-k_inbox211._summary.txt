Mark and Kim are coordinating due diligence for the Questar Southern Trails project. Eric Gadd asks Steve Dowd to stand in for him in commercial oversight. The LOI and nonbinding bid were faxed to Questar, and the team expects to be invited to the data room at the end of the month. They will assemble the due diligence team this week and plan to meet to create a process once they have access.
