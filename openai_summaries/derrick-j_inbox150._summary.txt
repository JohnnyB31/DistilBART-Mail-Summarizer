Rex Rogers is planning to make an offer to replace Ann Ballard and suggests that Haedicke's group continue supporting Xcelerator until new staffing is in place. Jim Derrick is asked if his group wants to take on this support. Jim is on the road and will be in the office tomorrow to discuss further. Heath Schiesser notes that due to Whalley's promotion, Xcelerator will stay under Corporate instead of moving to EWS, and asks Jim if he wants to continue requesting support from Mark Haedicke's group or from someone else. Heath also wants to discuss the company's ability to compete with another firm later in the week.
