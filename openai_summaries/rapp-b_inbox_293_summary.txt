The Red Rock Expansion Station 4 project has been officially removed from the expansion plan due to market conditions. Instead of building a new unit at Station 4, existing units will be overhauled to increase capacity by 120 mmcf/d. Environmental and Regulatory Affairs will withdraw the air permit application and make necessary filings accordingly. Larry Campbell is handling the related tasks.
