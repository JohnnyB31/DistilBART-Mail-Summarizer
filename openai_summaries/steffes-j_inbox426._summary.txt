The ERCOT board election is ongoing, with nominations and votes happening. Jean Ryall is working to secure votes for Charles Yeung to get a seat on TAC, and has already secured votes for a board seat from other market participants. The joint meeting of the Electric Restructuring Oversight Committee and the PUC is scheduled for December 5 at 9:00 a.m. in room E1.030 at the Capitol to review market opening progress. Doug Gilbert-Smith suggests Jean should run for the board seat due to his connections. Charles is attending a meeting in Austin on Thursday.
