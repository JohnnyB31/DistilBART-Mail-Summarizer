The email thread discusses reviewing procedures related to Manitoba-Hydro and MHEB. Don Baughman asks the team to read the attached Word document about procedures and to try to maximize their relationship with MHEB by moving as many MW as possible based on the MHEB reference price. John Kinser provides additional details, noting that with the end of August, more power, especially on-peak, is now available that was previously under contract, creating more opportunities to move this power. Both encourage team members to call them with questions.
