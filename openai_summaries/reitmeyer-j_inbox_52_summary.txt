The email thread discusses organizing weekly Wed Gas Fundies meetings starting at 3:00 PM with all interested parties dialed in via AT&T. There will be no formal Rockies Fundies meeting today as Jay will be in the air, and instead, a general discussion with Frank, Steve, and Canada will occur. Mike requests coordination with Keith to email the meeting itinerary and ensure the meeting room is cleared and handouts are emailed before each meeting.
