The emails discuss unpaid invoices from MAIN region for 2002 assessments, with Enron not expected to pay unless there is an ongoing Enron position. Enron's subsidiaries, Enron SE and EPMI, have past due amounts of $3,925.45 and $13,426.43 respectively. There is concern about potential issues for Newco if Enron is considered an owner, and whether legal teams have addressed this. Christi will follow up if payment is warranted.
