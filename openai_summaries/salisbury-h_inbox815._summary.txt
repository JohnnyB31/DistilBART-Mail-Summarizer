The email thread discusses whether the transmission demand charge for a April deal was calculated correctly. Heather Dunton explains that the demand charge was applied once for the entire month despite the deal being split into three strips due to daylight savings. Nikolay Kraltchev confirms that the demand charge was correctly calculated as 1330 * 50 = 66,500, applying the charge once for the whole period. Will Smith is asked to investigate how the demand charges are calculated by PCS, with Heather questioning if the monthly demand charge is based on a single strip or multiple strips.
