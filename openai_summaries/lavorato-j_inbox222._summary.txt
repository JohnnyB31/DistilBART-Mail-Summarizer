The Longview DASH project faces significant costs: terminating equipment by 10/31/01 will result in a $23 million write-off plus $3 million in development costs; extending orders to 11/30/01 will cost an additional $5.3 million; extending to 12/31/01 will cost a total of $8.7 million (including previous charges). Termination before year-end offers no material recovery.
