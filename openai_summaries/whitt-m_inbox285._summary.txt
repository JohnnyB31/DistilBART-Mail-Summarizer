Barry reviewed the West Gas 3Q YTD Origination file and believes it is accurate up to the end of Q3. Carol sent a revised origination schedule for the third quarter and asked for revisions by October 31. Barry will review and advise if there are any variances. Carol will consolidate all team originations and submit them to Louise.
