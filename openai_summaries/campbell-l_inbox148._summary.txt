The NYISO will soon post the ICAP Stage 2 manual and a new timeline for Winter 2001/2002. Market participants involved in UCAP auctions need to complete new Purchase and Sales agreements and have a NYISO "Registrant Name" and "Password" to submit their certification forms. Until the new timeline is available, a similar timeline can be viewed via the provided link.
