The email thread discusses setting up new meters for Kern Las Vegas, with some meters needing to be configured by schedulers. Jason confirms the zone and UNA meter exist, but two meters still need setup, and the zone should be PG&E instead of Socal. Melba asks Jason to verify details and inquire about the curve and Nymex Ref. Anne offers to provide additional information and asks to be informed of updates.
