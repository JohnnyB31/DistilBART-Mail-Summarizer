Tyrell Harrison and Marcus Eller discussed CSU's preference to use their own contract for deals. CSU is picky about contract sections, and Tyrell's legal team wants a Master Firm Agreement with CSU, to which specific deal details will be attached. Marcus asked Tyrell to review the attached contract, and Tyrell shared the Master Firm Agreement for review and promised to send the Transaction Agreement shortly. Tyrell also asked for feedback from CSU's legal team.
