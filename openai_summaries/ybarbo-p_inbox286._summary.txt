Miguel is preparing the sales contract for LPG supply to Humberto and needs to know if he will charge MB plus 12 months. Javier explains the terms of the supply, which will last 4 months starting in June, with prices varying from MB + 11.00 to MB + 12.00. Javier suggests sending the model contract to Humberto so he can be ready after the Progasco sale closes.
