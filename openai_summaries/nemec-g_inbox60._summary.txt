The email thread discusses a Bridgeline Holding L.P. Guaranty, with the guaranty amount set at $1.00MM. Rudwell Johnson requests Gerald Nemec to review and execute the guaranty and mentions having minor questions. Trevor Mihalik indicates they will discuss this further tomorrow. An attached guaranty document has been reviewed by their legal department. Additionally, there are contracts in the name of Bridgeline Gas Distribution with no activity over the past year, raising the question of whether to remove it from the approved bidders list or include it in the guaranty.
