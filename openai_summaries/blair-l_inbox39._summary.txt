Raetta is trying to get Post Rock to sign their extension agreement so they can send overdue invoices. Post Rock has not paid invoices for nearly a year and may consider the deal terminated. Craig explains that the agreement was amended to extend the term to 5 years, but Post Rock has not paid and may be nominating the contract. Raetta may need help from Marketing, and Larry or Loren are the account managers for Post Rock. Craig and Raetta are involved in addressing these issues.
