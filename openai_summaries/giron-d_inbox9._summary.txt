The email thread discusses the new URL for NETCO Sitara Reporting, which is http://sitrpt.netco.enron.com. Krishna informs all NETCO users to use this new URL. Susan checked her Sitara Reports access and was able to log in, but only Enron business units appeared, indicating the systems are not yet synchronized. She asks if there is another way to access the UBSW testing contract/deals.
