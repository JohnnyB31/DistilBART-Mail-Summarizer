Tom Martin's ESOP change request is delayed due to a blackout period until November 20th caused by a vendor switch. Irma Alvarez mistakenly forwarded his form to the wrong department and is re-routing it to the correct group. She offers to follow up after the blackout period. Laura Vuittonet requests notification when the ESOP update is received and asks if Tom should call about it.
