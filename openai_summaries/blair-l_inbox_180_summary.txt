The email thread discusses the possibility of filtering critical outbound messages from applications to prevent virus spread and ensure communication during outages. Jean McFarland is working with the messaging team to develop guidelines, noting that certain emergency messages, like virus-related alerts, can be managed to avoid further infection. Bradley Holmes emphasizes the need to investigate maintaining outbound TMS and critical notices during virus disruptions, as outages have previously caused significant communication delays. Key concerns include whether these messages could cause further infection and how to keep critical messages flowing during such periods. Jean will continue to update the team on progress.
