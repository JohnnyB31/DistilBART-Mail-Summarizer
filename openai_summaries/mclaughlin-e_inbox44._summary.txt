The email discusses planning and confirming participants for the upcoming NETCO regression test scheduled for next week, with activities on Monday and Tuesday. The date correction indicates the test will be on February 4th and 5th, not February 3rd and 4th, and notes that there will be no work on Super Bowl Sunday. The team is reviewing whether any participants need to retain estate IDs during the transition to UBS this Sunday, as access to the estate will be limited. The email includes attached test schedules for review.
