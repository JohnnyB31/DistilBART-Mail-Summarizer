Shelley Corman informed Danny McCarty that her team prepared a revenue report showing $180.6 million in gross transportation revenue for TW over 12 months, which has been shared with Kevin Howard. She noted a discrepancy with Tracy's figure of $200 million, mainly due to fuel sales not included in her numbers. Shelley also mentioned that her staff worked late to compile the report and that the data has been furnished to relevant stakeholders.
