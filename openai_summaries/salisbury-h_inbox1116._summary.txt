The team needs to make the Enpower sale for 7 MW at Colstrip on Monday, June 4, and treat any length over 7 MW as normal. Cara reports being 7 MW long at Montana System, with a false schedule to Smurfit to keep it flat, which must be removed around HE 0100, and the energy needs to be sold. They ask not to mention the false schedule explicitly, instead saying it was 'unexpectedly ramped down'.
