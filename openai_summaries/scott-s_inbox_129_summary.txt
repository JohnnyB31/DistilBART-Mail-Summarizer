The PSCo filed an application with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission on September 17, 2001, to decrease the Gas Cost Adjustment (GCA) rates, which are expected to take effect on October 1, 2001. The new proposed GCA rates reflect a decrease in natural gas market prices, with slight increases in transportation charges. The proposed rates are posted on the website for informational purposes. The final rates are subject to PUC approval, and notice of the final GCA rates will be posted after approval.
