The team is planning to transfer the Convertible Arbitrage Book back to ECT Investments before year-end to avoid SEC 13F reporting for ENA. Sheila discusses concerns about trading locations and disclosure of positions, and she asks Gary how strongly he feels about keeping the book in ECT Investments. Theresa is contacting GS and MSDW to clarify requirements. Sheila also mentions that moving the book involves setting up new broker agreements if separated from ENA.
