The ANNGTC MOU is being revised to include all parties on one document instead of separate signings. Enron's position is non-binding; they will not rejoin until liabilities are cleared. The revised MOU is attached for review, and comments are requested. The group plans to proceed under current terms, with amendments to be discussed later.
