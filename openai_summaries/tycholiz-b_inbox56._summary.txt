Alan Meyer was informed by Ron Whitehead that Les Rawson arranged for Dave Fuller to visit on 6/13 to discuss natural gas opportunities. Alan emphasizes the importance of John Malowney as the main contact with Enron and hopes he can attend or reschedule the meeting so he can be available. Dave Fuller set up the visit himself, not Rawson.
