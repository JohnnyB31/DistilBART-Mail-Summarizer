David and Michelle are discussing a potential protocol for hiring employees between Dynegy and Enron. Michelle mentions that Kristen Kracraft from Dynegy indicated interest in such a protocol, and that Rick Shapiro's group may have a member interested in moving to Dynegy, which David will clarify with Andrea. Michelle emphasizes caution to avoid a floodgate effect. David will cover this topic with Andrea tomorrow.
