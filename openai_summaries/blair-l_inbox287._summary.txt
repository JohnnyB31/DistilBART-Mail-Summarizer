The email thread discusses disputed charges related to NNG's October 2001 invoice. Tom Gesell from MidAmerican reports that their October invoice includes overrun charges ($56,078.52 total) that their metering does not support, and requests verification of measurements. MEC is instructed to short pay the DDVC charges of $26,374 and the IT overrun invoice of $29,704.52, indicating they will dispute these amounts. The billing details specify the quantities and rates involved, and MEC is advised to pay only the standard rates, not the overrun charges.
