Vince is coordinating a call regarding a new statistical database management system developed by Dr. Tom Limperis. The call can be scheduled anytime before the Ful Requirements meeting today or after the EGM morning meeting on Monday at 3:30 pm. Dorothy Dalton provided Tom Limperis's contact information and asked Vince to return the call, which he plans to do with a group member who has a PhD in computer science.
