The email discusses the distribution of contact lists for the top 50 gas and power customers, with instructions that each Master User should be contacted unless responsible for neither gas nor power. The person identified under the "PA" column will call the Master Users, and if all are not contacted within 2 days of the "Green Light" for PA marketing, the NetcoOnline marketing team will make the calls. A PA marketing pack with relevant materials will be sent soon.
