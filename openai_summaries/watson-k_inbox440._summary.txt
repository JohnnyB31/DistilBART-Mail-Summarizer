Steven Harris is trying to find the contact person in Las Vegas for Southwest Gas, but he hasn't received the name and number yet. Lorraine checked with Nevada Power about fuel procurement and capacity, but last contact was two years ago, and no direct approach has been made to Las Vegas Cogen. Nevada Power's largest customers include power plants like El Dorado, Nevada Cogen, and Saguro Power Plant. Several parties are planning or building new power plants in Southern Nevada, including Mirant, Reliant, Calpine, PG&E, and Pinnacle West.
