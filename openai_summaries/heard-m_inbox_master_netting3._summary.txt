Leslie Hansen is coordinating with the credit group to prepare a draft of the Reliant Master Netting Agreement, including a list of Reliant entities, trading contracts, and credit terms. She requests that Dede Russo at Reliant receive the draft with the Collateral Annex via email, noting Leslie's request and ongoing customization. Leslie will not be in the office on Wednesday and wants all Reliant documents by Thursday morning. She has asked Martha Keesler for assistance in pulling contracts from LiveLink.
