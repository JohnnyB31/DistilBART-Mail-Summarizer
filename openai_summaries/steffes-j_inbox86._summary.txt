The email thread discusses the status of employees on the NEWCO Regulatory List. Susan Lindberg and Charles Yeung were let go, but there is concern about whether other key individuals, including Alan Comnes, are still employed. Susan will report to Jim Steffes tomorrow, and Charles plans to call Jim to discuss his role. Louise asks to confirm if all listed employees are still with the company, indicating a need to retain certain staff for NEWCO.
