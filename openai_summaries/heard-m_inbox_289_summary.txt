Anne and Eugenia are planning to meet on Thursday, possibly for dinner and a movie. Eugenia asks what they are doing and where to meet. They discuss going to an early movie and then eating, possibly ribs at Luthers or a Whataburger. Eugenia offers to bring raw oysters from Nelson's, as Marie's restaurants have likely closed. Eugenia will check movie times and let Anne know when to be there.
