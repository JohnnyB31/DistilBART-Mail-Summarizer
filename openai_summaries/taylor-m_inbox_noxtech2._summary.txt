Trevor received a message from Nat Kreamer about leveraging NOxTech to support ENE's market strategies and develop peaking units. Nat mentions that he cannot help much but asks to be kept in the loop. He discusses the benefits of NOxTech, including gaining market insights, generating profits, and supporting peaking units with potential cash flows and contingency plans. Nat also references an attached presentation related to double trigger contingent calls.
