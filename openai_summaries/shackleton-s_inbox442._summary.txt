Marie is finalizing the documentation for Jeff's signature on the CSFB agreement and requests contact information to send the documents to CSFB. Tom mentions that Jeff Kinneman suggested that legal could scan and edit the signature pages instead of recreating the document, as CSFB cannot provide the original Word document. The team is awaiting advice on the expected timeframe to complete the document, and the process is urgent because trading is currently shut off.
