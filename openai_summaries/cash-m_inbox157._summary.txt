Carey Sloan is seeking assistance from Michelle Cash to find out if there is any information they can tell Carey about his payout under his executive agreement, which he fears he may not receive due to bankruptcy issues. Carey emphasizes that he did not ask to replace Bruce Wrobel as CEO and extended his assignment in Japan, and he is upset about the $55 million retention bonus payout while he has no payout or severance. He requests Michelle's best efforts to help him and mentions his financial and personal difficulties living in Tokyo.
