Juan Hernandez is seeking volunteers to work holiday shifts during Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day, offering holiday pay. Reese Trejo states he wants to work every holiday except New Year's Eve/Day due to needing the money. Juan asks colleagues to specify their holiday work preferences and to email vacation requests for November and December. Participants will be selected by drawing straws if there are too many volunteers.
