Frank and Tanya discuss improving correlation analysis by increasing the number of factors and doing joint factors analysis for all curves, to better capture the term structure of correlations. Tanya suggests this approach will not increase computational requirements. Frank emphasizes the urgency, noting Louise Kitchen wants the implementation today, and mentions that correlations were calculated over the last 60 days using log returns, with Bharat having run the correlations. They also consider using heat rate for correlation calculations.
