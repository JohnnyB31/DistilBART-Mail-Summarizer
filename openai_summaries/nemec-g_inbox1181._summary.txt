Ellen asked Judy to forward all well information for the Linder Oil confirmations, but Judy clarified that well information is only for tracking and not needed in the confirmations. Judy also instructed that the confirmations for August and through October must be GTC Firm with modified MDQ language, to be prepared quickly so they can be sent out by August 10th for the pre-pay process.
