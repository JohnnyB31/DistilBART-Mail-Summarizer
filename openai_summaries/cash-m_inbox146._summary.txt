The email thread discusses December 2000 Tax Equalization Payments (TEQ) for employees, which are needed to pay US tax liabilities before the December 15 deadline. There is a list of employees awaiting off-cycle checks, and the payments are to IRS or tax authorities. The team is seeking legal guidance on whether these payments are considered "business" expenses and whether they can be processed quickly. Michelle and Mary Jean are asked to provide a ruling, and assistance is requested to push the payments through.
