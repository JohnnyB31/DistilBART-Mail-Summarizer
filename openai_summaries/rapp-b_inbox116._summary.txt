Frazier requests Janet to update a transfer form to reflect a change in the company name for employee Stephen Allen, effective 1/1/02. Miranda corrects the company name to Enron Asset Management Resource, not NNG, and confirms Stephen Allen's transfer to ETS from Enron Corp. with new position Dir. Facility Audits. Frazier asks Bill Rapp to sign the revised form with the same date as the original. Miranda advises saving her email in the "Reports" folder.
