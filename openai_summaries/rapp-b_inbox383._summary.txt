Drew Fossum and colleagues discuss replacing Andy Fastow at Northern Natural. Andy is on a leave of absence, not left the company. Cindy Olson is suggested as a replacement, as she is neither an officer nor director of a marketing affiliate or Northern. Greg Porter agrees to the change and defers to Drew and Bill Rapp to choose the replacement. Drew advises getting input from MKM and Joe Hartsoe before proceeding.
