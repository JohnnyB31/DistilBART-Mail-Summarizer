The email discusses the July and September 2001 TW Balance Report, with an attached file for review. The report shows that Fuel Retention numbers are accurate, but Fuel Burned numbers are underestimated due to missing data; estimates should be increased by 25%. The remaining volumes relate to imbalances and UAF, which need further discussion, especially Ken’s report, which requires work. Dan explains that sales impact the bottom line, but selling imbalance gas or linepack involves commodity risk. Ken’s report is attached, and further discussions are planned.
