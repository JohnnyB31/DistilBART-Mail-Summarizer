Eric states that he will not change their position on making no collective response to Senator Murkowski during the teleconference with Dennis at 5pm, emphasizing the importance of their name and strategic interests. Danny asks whether he should call Dennis or wait for Dennis to call him. Eric provides a summary of the telecon discussion, noting that liability issues are overwhelming and the GP role is not feasible until residual claims go away. They are prepared to exchange residual claims for AFUDC and interest accruals to become a 9.4% GP later, or walk away from these if they do not rejoin as GP, seeking reimbursement of historic capital contributions. Eric also mentions that they will make their own response to Murkowski, as they are not comfortable with a collective one.
