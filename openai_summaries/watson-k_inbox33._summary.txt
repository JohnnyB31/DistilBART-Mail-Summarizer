Kevin Hyatt is having a new analyst, David Junus, review the CPUC order related to the SoCal RLS Tariff revision to help the So Trails project. Kimberly Watson has discussed the same issue with Glenn Hass and Questar, with Gary Schmitt showing cautious optimism but awaiting the full order. Additionally, Gwen Soong forwarded the draft decision of ALJ Brown regarding the approval of a change to the SoCalGas peaking rate tariff, which includes SFV rate design, demand charges based on peak usage over 12 months, and public purpose charges. Kimberly expects to receive the final decision within a few days.
