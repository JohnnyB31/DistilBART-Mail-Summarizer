The Bammel inventory between ENA and HPLC has not been consolidated; ENA has a positive gas balance, and HPLC has a negative balance. To proceed with the sale of working gas to AEP, Enron needs to execute a confirm and deal ticket under the existing agreement to consolidate the inventory. Jim Pond requests the exact gas volumes to be moved, and David Baumbach is asked to coordinate the execution of these documents. There have been previous attempts to transfer the gas, but no action has been taken yet.
