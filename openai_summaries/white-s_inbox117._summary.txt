Ramesh provided a list of users for RisktRAC access, which Debbie and W. White are asked to review and suggest changes. They also need to discuss plans for book/portfolio setups. Ramesh will be in early tomorrow but leaves around 10:45-11:00 AM due to a Jeff Johnson meeting, and they are asked to meet the next morning.
