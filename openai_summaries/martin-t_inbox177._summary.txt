The email thread discusses organizational changes involving Dave B. and the trading and risk management teams. Jeffrey Gossett indicates he plans for Dave to run the west risk desk and leave Texas operations unchanged, while Thomas Martin suggests reassigning Dave to the Texas Risk group to support cash trading activities. Jeffrey wants to confirm if Dave will return to their organization, as he will have lost about 30% of staff and will need all remaining personnel. They plan to discuss further when Jeffrey is available.
