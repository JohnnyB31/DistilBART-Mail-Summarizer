Sheila proposes to create a letter on behalf of Enron Corp, authorized by Andy Fastow in June, allowing Ben Glisan and Tim Despain to withdraw funds from the MSDW account. She suggests that she and Jill can sign the letter before it is sent to Andy for approval, instead of using the Corporate Secretary. She asks for comments and advice on this process.
