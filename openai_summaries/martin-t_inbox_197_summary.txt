The email thread discusses the Bammel Working Gas Sale to AEP, with plans to notify AEP of the volume and value during a meeting this week. It estimates that by the end of May, approximately 3+ TBTU will be injected, resulting in AEP owing around $98 million. The team considers whether accounting should include this amount in the June settlement and if any contractual actions are needed. Jim Schwieger provides updates on gas volumes and costs, and Brian Redmond suggests developing a process to update AEP without compromising trading positions.
