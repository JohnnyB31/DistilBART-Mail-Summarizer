Jason calculated Heartland Steel's mark-to-market exposure as of COB Jan. 24, 2001, totaling approximately $1,078,209. There is a net receivable of about $700,000 (including ~$305,000 for December gas and ~$395,000 for January gas). Valerie notes a $75,000 contract termination fee that was not entered in the system and was not paid, and about $92,177.09 owed for volume adjustments after Jan. 24. These amounts should be included in negotiations. Jason's calculation does not include the entire termination payment, which also depends on the net receivable.
