Mansoor informs Earl that engineering standards are available for selection and will be sent soon. Earl mentions that the equipment for the proposed interconnect is being prepared, but the Enron internet is down, so he will email the standards later. Earl also states Jim Williams will review a typical I/C package and material list, which can be used to develop a cost estimate.
