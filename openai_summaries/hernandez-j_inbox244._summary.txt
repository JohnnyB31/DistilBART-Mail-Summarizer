Duke Energy will acquire a 400-megawatt facility from Enron in early October 2001. During this period, Kevin Presto will control the dispatch and premiums for the New Albany plant. Enron staff are instructed to ensure the plant is ready and available at all times to capture premiums. All calls or requests from non-Enron sources should be forwarded to Lloyd Will.
