Gerald sent final versions of the Servitude Agreement and Filing Form for review, with some changes made. Roger and Rakhi are asked to verify the legal description provided by Enterprise, including a plat that Gerald will forward. The review process is ongoing, and once everyone approves, they will be ready. Roger mentions he cannot verify the exact location of the pipe due to incomplete plat ties.
