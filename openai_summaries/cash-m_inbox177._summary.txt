Kalen Pieper is inquiring about whether the Enron matching gift commitment for Elizabeth Hutchinson's marathon fundraising will be honored and when the funds will be sent to the Leukemia Society. Elizabeth has raised $1,000 out of a $2,000 goal and is waiting for the $1,000 match. She is concerned about personally covering the amount if the match is not received, especially given recent layoffs. Fran Mayes is asked to help clarify the status of the matching funds.
