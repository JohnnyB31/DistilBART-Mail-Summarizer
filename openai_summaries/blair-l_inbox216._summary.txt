The team discussed an Accounts Receivable issue with Oneok for about $99,000 that needs resolution before agreeing to an OBA. Delaine Kurth from Oneok called to request an OBA at the Cargray Plant effective 1/1/2002, with a draft to be prepared by Karen. The issue of unresolved receivables is a key concern affecting the OBA agreement.
