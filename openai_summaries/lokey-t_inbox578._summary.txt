Shelley and Rachel discuss setting up a subscription to Platts for the Gas Daily Table, with Rachel planning to sign up for a package costing $1990 per year. Shelley suggests that the charges should be recorded to the balancing tools account, and they consider whether Galen Coon should be the designated user since he handles related postings. Rachel will confirm and proceed with the subscription, including providing user and billing details. Shelley will check with Sheila about who should handle the setup.
