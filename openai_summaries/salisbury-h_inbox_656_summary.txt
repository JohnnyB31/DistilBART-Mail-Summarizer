The new 280-MW Rathdrum power plant unit 2 in Idaho is in the final test phase, which started recently. The company has not confirmed the exact date for commercial operation, but it remains ahead of schedule, with a target of November. Previous attempts at the final test were abandoned due to unspecified problems.
