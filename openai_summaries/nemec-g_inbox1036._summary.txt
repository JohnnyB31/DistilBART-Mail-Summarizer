Stacey Richardson provides an update on the Holcomb Oil and Gas Inc./Key Gas Holding deal, explaining that the current contract does not cover a broad agreement and that she has asked Susan Herrera at Holcomb to send a proper assignment letter. Once received, the Global Counterparty group will set up the counterparty, and Sharon will process the assignment. The timeline for splitting or repathing the deal depends on this process. Stacey also shares a link to the counterparty request form and offers to submit it if Kelli Stevens provides the necessary information, noting she does not have access to change the counterparty on the deal.
