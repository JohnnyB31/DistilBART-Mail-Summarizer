Diane Fellers is requesting Kimberly Watson to provide a cost center for allocations from the Research group, which need to be ready to run by Friday due to an early close. Kimberly is finalizing details with Dan McCarty and Eric Gadd and will update Diane in a couple of weeks. Diane emphasizes the urgency, as the allocations must be run today and she wants to catch up on previous months' amounts.
