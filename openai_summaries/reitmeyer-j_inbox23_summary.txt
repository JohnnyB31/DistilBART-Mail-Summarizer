The Wyoming Interstate Company (WIC) will have maintenance on October 30, 2001, during which one unit at Douglas Station will be out of service for about 8 hours, reducing throughput to approximately 360 MMcf/d. Theresa asks Jackie and Shelly to check how much Medicine Bow capacity will be affected and to ensure the difference is sold into KN at Glenrock. Dinah informs that WIC's throughput will be reduced and advises contacting marketers to confirm gas delivery, as allocations will follow WIC's allocation methods.
