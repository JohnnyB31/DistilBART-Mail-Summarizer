Michael Bodnar is asked to discuss storage issues with Lynn Blair. Tim Johanson spoke with Steve Sweeney at Cogentrix about discrepancies in storage data from June 1 to September 30, 2001, which need further exploration because the spreadsheet data conflicts with Steve's information. Steve is impatient and wants a quick resolution. Tim recommends meeting with Kent Miller once the spreadsheet is finished to discuss their offer to Cogentrix.
