The email discusses potential gas flow increases at Hobbs System, including scheduling gas directly to Golden Spread POI-71395 and increasing capacity at Altura Gaines to handle up to 30,000-40,000 dths/d. Altura plans to modify equipment and expand the processing plant in early 2002. There is also consideration of flow arrangements with Mustang and concerns from Dynegy about frequent allocations affecting their volumes. Key participants include Gary, Sherry, Joe, and others involved in gas control and operations. No specific dates or meetings are mentioned beyond the 11/20 meeting.
