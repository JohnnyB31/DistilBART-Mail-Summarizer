Peoples Gas has dropped its request for a letter of credit and will accept a parental guaranty by December 3, with about $40k at stake. They will send a letter stating that any rating downgrade will require an l/c or cash deposit. Gloria agrees that the matrix is tracking this info, but currently only for electric utility registrations, and they are trying to locate gas utility registration info.
