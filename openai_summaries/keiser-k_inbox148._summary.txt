Chris Abel provided a spreadsheet for DPR reporting, asking recipients to fill it out and email it before noon on Wednesdays and Mondays. Kam Keiser requested to be added to the distribution list for DPR issues, and Jeffrey Gossett confirmed this. Chris emphasized that the reporting process is temporary and will be streamlined later, including only active deal information.
