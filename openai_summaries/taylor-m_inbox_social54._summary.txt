Kristen Hanson knew Sarah Armstrong from Trinity, where she was a good student and possibly involved with Sigma. Jay Vandenberg asked Kristen about Sarah because a colleague's friend is curious, and Kristen confirmed she worked at Exxon and graduated in 2000. Kristen has been working long hours recently, missing her dog Dixie, who is eager to come home after Thanksgiving.
