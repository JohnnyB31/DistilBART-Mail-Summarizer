The email thread discusses updates to the Infinity Customer Solutions contract, including adding a supervisor at a different rate. Daniel Burke asks Amy Gambill for guidance on who to contact about these contract changes. Amy suggests adding a PWD to reflect the new rate for the director. There is also an inquiry about whether Enron can pay Infinity electronically.
