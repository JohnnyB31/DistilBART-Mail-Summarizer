The Property Accounting Users Group requests that Tracy Geaccone instruct the ISC to roll over the 2002 IM structure for both ETS Consolidated and ETS Un-Consolidated on November 1, to set up 2002 projects and input the 2002 budget once approved. Tracy approves the request and is asked to email Marian Bryant with the approval and the date. The group recommends doing the rollover on November 1.
