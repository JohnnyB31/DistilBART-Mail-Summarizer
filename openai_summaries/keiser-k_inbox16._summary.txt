Cecilia did not receive any request for new books and asks Casey to send the request form. Casey lists several books that were previously sent to John but are missing from the list, and mentions that Cecilia has some books already set up. Casey also attaches a spreadsheet detailing changes to the East Power UBS Book Listing due to offer declines.
