The move for the 6th floor is scheduled for Friday, 2/8, with details still uncertain. Staff are instructed to pack and be ready early that morning, and to clear out their desks. Boxes are limited; staff are asked to request or collect boxes in advance. Labels will arrive Friday morning, and a floor plan is attached to help staff and groups know where to report on Monday. Sonia Hennessy will provide updates if there are any changes.
