Alan Julson will visit town from June 23 to June 30, staying with Becky and possibly needing a place to crash on poker night. He plans to attend an Astros game on June 24, hang out with Shelly, and enjoy meals and margaritas. Jason Wolfe is preparing a poker game before Alan's arrival and will remind him. Alan mentions that Lissa's wedding has been canceled but he will still hang out with Shelly.
