Christian and Steve asked if they will be reimbursed for their cell phone expenses. AT&T will suspend some Enron corporate cell phone accounts starting 12/7, with remaining accounts terminated by 12/11. Employees can convert their phones to personal accounts, with AT&T waiving the activation fee. Management-approved cell phones are eligible for expense reimbursement based on business need. Elizabeth inquired about reimbursement.
