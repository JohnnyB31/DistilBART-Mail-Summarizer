Beth is considering going camping in Austin with her mom's family from July 26-28, including activities like riding a train to Burnett. Her mom has paid for the trip, and Beth plans to keep her phone number. Beth has decided not to send Kevin Dikes' resume anywhere for now. She also provides her new address in Houston and mentions she will handle the Nextel bill either by paying it or having her mom mail it to her.
