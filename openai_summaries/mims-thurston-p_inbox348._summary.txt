Sylvia had Andy fax her a copy of the ROFR form for the NSS Storage Contract #114846, which ends on March 2, 2002, with a 1 BCF storage on the Gulf leg at $3.07 per MDQ of 13,333 monthly. The contract renewal notification date was originally 12/5/01, but a revised letter incorrectly stated 12/31/01; Sylvia was advised to disregard the revised date and stick with the original. Sylvia has forwarded the contract details to Tom D. and will pass the faxed form to others.
