Britt Davis is handling three insurance claims that need extensions of time for suit against Underwriters, with requests to be sent soon to avoid vacation delays. The claims include Enron Petrochemicals, which has a fully documented claim but may not have been paid yet, raising concerns about potential delays. An extension does not prevent filing suit later if payment is not received by year-end. Britt plans to send the extension requests and invites comments.
