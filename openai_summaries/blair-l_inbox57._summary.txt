Jean Blair provides WP&L's spreadsheet showing outstanding contracts, DDVC, and imbalance invoices, along with a writeoff agreement form. Chris Sebesta requests an update on Gas Logistics' discussions with WP&L regarding payment or resolution, as well as WP&L's position, before approving a write-off. Jean offers to review and edit the documentation and suggests that approving the write-off would clear WP&L's historical business.
