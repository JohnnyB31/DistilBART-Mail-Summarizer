Lynn was informed about storage allocations and is checking if Mike, Sue, and Kent have seen the information. Kelly Schneider from Alliant Energy wants confirmation of their firm storage rights for the upcoming holiday weekend, including maximum withdrawals and the ability to reduce withdrawals to zero. The team had a conference call with Kelly and others, but they did not reach an agreement, and Kelly emphasizes the importance of confirming their rights by 3:00 pm.
