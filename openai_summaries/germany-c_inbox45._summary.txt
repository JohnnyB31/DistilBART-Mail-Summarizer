The payment to Dominion (Louis Dreyfus) for gas in February 2002 is not to be made immediately, as the amount will be resolved through a settlement with Louis Dreyfus. Chris requested a payment of $10,334.67, which was scheduled for June 17th, but Ed instructed not to pay and to resolve issues via settlement instead. Chris planned to prepare the wire transfer documentation and pass it to Susan for approval, following the usual process.
