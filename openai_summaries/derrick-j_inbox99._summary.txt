The update discusses challenges in the Dabhol project, including Indian banks trying to get foreign banks to fund a project with a repudiated PPA, influenced by the Indian government. There is concern that foreign banks may stop funding soon, but Indian banks might act to cure construction contract payments of about $34 million this month. The Indian bank facility is expected to be fully funded within a few months. Additionally, a writ petition was filed in the Bombay High Court challenging MERC's jurisdiction, with a hearing scheduled but uncertain.
