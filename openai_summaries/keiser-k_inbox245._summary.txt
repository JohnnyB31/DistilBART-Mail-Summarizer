The team is coordinating on the TXU contract termination dates and MTM values. Harlan provided a spreadsheet to be cleaned up and used to assign values, with a plan to factor in LDs with MTM exposure. Carl Tricoli requests the MTM values by the end of the day and plans a meeting tomorrow to discuss next steps. Harlan is available for questions.
