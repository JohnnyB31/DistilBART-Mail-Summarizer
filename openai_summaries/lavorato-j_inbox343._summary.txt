The email thread discusses the top 100 exposures report, which shows exposures by counterparty and Enron entity level. Bill will provide all exposures with collateral rights later and mentions that the data is being scrubbed for assignment opportunities to reduce margin positions, with a briefing scheduled for tomorrow. The report file "Top 100 Exposures 101901.xls" is attached. The discussion includes whether Petrocanada's posting affects the balance sheet or ability to post more letters of credit, and which companies have rights to call collateral. The data has not been checked for accuracy.
