Andrea Yowman shared a draft 'Enron Diversity Overview' document and requested updates from various owners of diversity efforts before a 2:45 p.m. meeting. Michelle Cash reviewed the draft, suggested that the 'governmental relationships' bullet may not fit under 'compliance' and proposed renaming the section to 'HR Risk Mitigation/management,' including additional compliance and legal topics. Andrea plans to incorporate Michelle's points and fine-tune the document accordingly.
