Ernesto asked Pam to confirm the start date of Accro's commercial operation, which was July 6, 2001, but Pam responded it was July 9, 2001. He also requested an updated NPV calculation of $18.331 million related to Enron's interest, to be reviewed and signed off by RAC, Jim Hughes, Stan Horton, the Compensation Committee, and possibly the Creditor Committee and E&Y. Ernesto inquired about who in RAC is available to review the financials and whether Pam has spoken to anyone there.
