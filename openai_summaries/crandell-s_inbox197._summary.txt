Sean Crandall's team requested and pulled a large amount of data for a lawsuit, which was difficult due to tracking issues. Cara played a key role in bridging data gaps, enabling successful delivery of accurate data for the DC consultants and FERC filing. Sean recommends Cara receive a $2,000 Personal Best Award. Amy will submit the request today and expects to know the outcome by the end of the week.
