The email thread discusses a call scheduled for Thursday about Enron's position on electric reliability legislation and NERC's role. John provides a marked-up and a clean copy of the latest proposal, which differs from PJM's approach. David Cook from NERC shares a shorter version of the reliability language developed with support from EEI, APPA, and the Canadian Electricity Association, and mentions that all supporters of the current language are expected to support the shorter draft. Comments are requested by tomorrow, and support from additional stakeholders like ELCON, Enron, or EPSA is uncertain.
