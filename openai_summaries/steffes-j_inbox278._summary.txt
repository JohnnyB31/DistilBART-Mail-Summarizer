The email discusses the current strategy and organization of renewables within wholesale and retail businesses, with updates from Stacey Bolton and Chris Calger. Stacey mentions that both West and East Desks have been established, working with generators to list RECs and developing product descriptions for customers. Chris Calger reports that Richard Ring has a mandate to set up a book to cover short positions in the East, while the West is more manageable. He advises working with wholesale parties and procuring tags for the East. The key focus is on managing renewables positions and coordinating efforts between teams.
