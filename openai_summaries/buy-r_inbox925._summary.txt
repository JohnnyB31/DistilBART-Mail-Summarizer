The El Paso BOD canceled the Miracle project due to capital sourcing uncertainty and requested an option until mid-February to evaluate alternatives, including an auction. A call notice for their LP interest is to be sent on Monday. There is concern about potential litigation from Brazos if an auction occurs, and the process may include financing outs depending on debt market recovery. The team is analyzing the project's value and NPVs, with discussions ongoing to decide the next steps.
