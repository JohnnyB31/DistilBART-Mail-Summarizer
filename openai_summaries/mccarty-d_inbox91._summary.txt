Phil Lowry is conducting a two-day trip to Oklahoma/Texas after Thanksgiving to meet with Beaver assets employees and invites someone familiar with Duke's status to join. He mentions that his VPs conduct teleconference calls with field employees every Monday and welcomes others to join. Danny McCarty offers help in meeting and communicating with the field, acknowledging Stan's workload, and asks about upcoming field visits. Phil will share an itinerary with Amelia.
