Jonathan is available in July, which Oman LNG prefers for their visit. The proposed agenda includes updates on Dabhol, implementation procedures, CMS terminal visit, and spot cargoes for 2001 and 2002. There is uncertainty about whether Oman LNG will be in Houston during that time, as Jonathan plans to be in Europe. Additionally, there is a meeting with Oman LNG scheduled for June 7-15, with discussions about their visit to CMS and possibly during the Hoegh Galleon unloading. Participants are asked to share their availability and suggest additional topics.
