Larry is pleased about the new contract and asks Eric about the impact of the new owner and whether S might be offered to stay. Eric expresses confidence in the leadership and mentions he signed with UBS, getting a better deal. Larry also notes that Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson are in town and involved in advocating for their interests, which Larry believes benefits their investments in ENE.
