The email thread discusses the review and testing of the AEP Enron Counterparty Setup Procedures Proposal. Bill Hare discussed the standards with Barbara Gray, passed her the draft document for review, and Jeff Klotz provided documentation for AEP access. The Global Counterparty system has completed preliminary testing, and further testing will begin soon. Bill Hare will follow up with Barbara later in the week.
