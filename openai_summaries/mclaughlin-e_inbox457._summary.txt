Joey received the Wednesday night procedures and has already passed them out. Errol instructed the team to finalize and officialize the books for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, with specific dates provided. They will need to copy and calc the books for Thursday and Friday on INEXACT because curves will not be uploaded for those days. This process is for credit purposes due to Thanksgiving.
