Enron was informed that they do not need to acquire additional capacity to avoid penalties, as the 35 MW capacity is in excess of their obligations. The market deadline to contract for capacity is December 28th. Enron's decision to end transaction #23454 could create a $570,000 deficiency, but they have the opportunity to make it up in the capacity market. Tom Moleski advised to call for further details.
