Lindy asked TK to update prices for the Stan Presentation, specifically for Nov/Dec 2001, and to include the NYMEX settle prices from Jan-Sept '01 if Vernon has them. TK provided a file named Lindypricing.xls for review, and Lindy requested the updates by the next day after lunch, noting she would be in a meeting from 8:00 to 12:00 and would check her voicemail during the break.
