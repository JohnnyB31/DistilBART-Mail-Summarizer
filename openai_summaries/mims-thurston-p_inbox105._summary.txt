Enron and Gulf agree on contract language for the Crestar/BP deal. Dan is asked to insert the clause into two contracts and send the updated versions. Enron needs to confirm if they must sign the assignment again or if acknowledgment suffices. The final BP document is attached for signing. All agreements should be signed by Tuesday afternoon to enable flow on Wednesday for Thursday's nomination cycle.
