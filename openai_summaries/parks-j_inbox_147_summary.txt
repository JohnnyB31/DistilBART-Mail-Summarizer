The email thread discusses issues with users logging into Enron's CQG system. Several users, including Joe Parks, have been unable to log in or remain logged in. Daniel Muschar instructs all users to reboot their machines at the end of the day to resolve the problem, and requests help in ensuring users log out after trading. Rick Le provides a list of users still logged in as of 10:05 AM on 04-29-2002, including Joe Parks and others, indicating the need for desktop support to have these users log out.
