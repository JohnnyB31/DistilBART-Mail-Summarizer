The team is planning to change the curve mappings for KERN/LasVegas from SOCAL to PG&E/Topock. There are three deals (numbers 452375, 459155, 434877) affected, which are associated with Petro-Canada - BC and Petro-Canada Hydrocarbons - BC, with activity starting in October. Anne requests to re-map the curves for Kern River Gas Transmission in the Las Vegas zone to NGI-SOBDR-PG&E and GDP-PG&E/TOPOCK. She asks Jason to check with the Canadian trader about the deals, as they lack access to Canadian deals, and also asks Brain to have someone look into this.
