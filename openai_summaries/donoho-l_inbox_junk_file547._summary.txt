Lindy Donoho reviewed the draft of TW's Section 7(c) application. Kelly Allen sent the draft for review and comment, noting that the exhibit section is incomplete. Lorraine Lindberg suggested that John Duschinske and Greg Porter might need to be listed as officers for Transwestern. Kelly indicated that the application requests authorization to add 10,000 Dth/day of capacity on Transwestern's San Juan lateral and mentioned that Kelly will find out from Bill Rapp whether John Duschinske and Greg Porter should be listed.
