Lynemartin and Margaret Bassani coordinate plans for attending the symphony on Sunday the 16th at 2:30. Margaret will leave four tickets for Lynemartin's group, including Krista. Tom may leave early and might need to pick up Lynemartin's parents. Lynemartin will pick up Krista and suggests meeting at the symphony to exchange tickets.
