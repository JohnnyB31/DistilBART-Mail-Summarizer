The email thread discusses the Vanalco Transmission contract, which has a demand of 170 MW divided among three POIs and a POD at Alcoa substation. The contract begins on October 1, 2001, and ends on September 30, 2002, with rollover rights. John Malowney is interested in discussing the contract with Diana Scholtes as a learning tool, and they are considering potential offers or buyers, noting the court process and future asset preservation.
