Linda clarified that POI 1635 is currently flowing one way and can be changed to bi-directional in PLE if needed. She is unsure about POI 56943, asking if it should be added to the displacement groups in PLE, and questions its relevance to West Texas. POI 500168 is a delivery point and cannot be changed to bi-directional unless it physically flows both ways; if used for displacement, it should be added to the displacement groups. Maggie states that POI 1635 and 500168 need to be labeled as bi-directional in PLE, and POI 56943 should be a displacement point in the IT and SP groups.
