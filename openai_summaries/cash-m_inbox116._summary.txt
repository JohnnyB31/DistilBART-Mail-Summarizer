The email thread discusses procedures related to employee leave of absence and benefits. It highlights the need to be careful about the terminology used for WARN notices to avoid disqualifying employees from benefits like AD&D. There is a suggestion to amend section 2.3(e) of the plan to require employees to be actively at work for six months before becoming eligible for severance, to make the policy neutral and avoid discrimination. The participants consider consulting the insurance company to ensure benefits are maintained during WARN leave or furlough.
