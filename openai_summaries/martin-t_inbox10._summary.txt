Margaret Bassani informed Lyne Martin that Jocelyn was fired due to her unbearable personality. She asked Homeinstead to provide a new caregiver, Cena, who is primarily a chauffeur and has previously driven for Mom and Dad. Cena will provide transportation for doctor and hair appointments on M, W, F from 2-6 pm, and the hours may expand if the right person is found.
