Wade is requesting wire instructions from Jeff if a payment of $100,000 to California PUC is required tomorrow, as the payment must be made by 12/26/01 to avoid suspension of EEMC registration and service to residential and small commercial accounts. Jeff is checking if the payment has already been made.
