David Fildes corrected a previous mistake by instructing to input lot number 1032 instead of 1031 to find the Great One. He shared a website link showing the item, which he describes as a valuable collector's piece resembling a late 70's drummer. He suggests a potential joint investment opportunity, noting the item's estimated price of about 25,000 Swedish Kroners (approximately $5,000 CAD).
