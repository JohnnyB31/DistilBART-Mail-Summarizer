Bob Hill attended the Friday conference call about the press release regarding the Producer's enabling legislation, but nothing significant was discussed as most companies, except possibly TCPL, decided not to issue a press release. The DC reps will start meeting on Alaskan matters, with Joe Hartsoe covering those meetings for Enron. Bob also attended Calgary meetings and plans to attend a Los Angeles meeting on the 12th to finalize model assumptions and the proposal before Christmas. An early January meeting with the Producers is scheduled to review the detailed commercial proposal, and Bob will send the executive summary. Eric Gadd missed the conference call and asked if anything of merit was discussed; he also circulated the draft press release for comments and inquired about the deadline.
