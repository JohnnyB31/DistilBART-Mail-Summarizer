Mike Grigsby is seeking information about shut-in costs in western Canada and plans to have Steve South and Paul Lucci analyze shut-in variables by field. Chris Dorland explains that shutting in eastern rocks production is unlikely due to risks of water out and logistical issues, and suggests coal bed methane is among the last to be shut in. Mike asks what variables to consider and requests their thoughts.
