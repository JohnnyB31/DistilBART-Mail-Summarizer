Bonnie received a call from Robert Minkoff about buying EPMI's claim in the PCA bankruptcy. Elizabeth confirmed that the PCA matter was settled about 6 months ago. Bonnie asked if EPMI still has a claim and whether they are interested in selling it; Elizabeth did not specify details but indicated the matter was settled. Bonnie will follow up accordingly.
