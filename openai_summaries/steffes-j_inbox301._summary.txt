The EIA is preparing to take over the AGA's storage survey after winter, pending OMB review and approval, which could take several months. The AGA plans to discontinue its survey in early January. EIA intends to start a similar weekly survey with mandatory participation, aiming to issue a schedule in early December. If AGA stops early, there may be a gap in weekly storage data for several months.
