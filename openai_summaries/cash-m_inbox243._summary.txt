The team discussed ERISA issues related to paying and terminating employees, emphasizing the importance of setting up arrangements to avoid tax and ERISA complications. They reviewed a trust arrangement to ensure it does not trigger taxes until payment, with considerations about funding, irrevocability, and whether to set up a new employer ID for security and tax deductibility. Michelle will follow up with external tax counsel. They also need to determine if the setup must be in a new employer entity and whether it applies to non-U.S. employees or insiders.
