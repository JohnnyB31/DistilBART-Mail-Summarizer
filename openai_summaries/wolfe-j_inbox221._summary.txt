Jason checked out the new building. Tara is excited about returning to Enron and is asking Jason about the differences between Origination, Structuring, and Transactions. Tara also inquires about Jason's current situation, including if he's still with Beth and working long hours. Tara plans to write a longer email later and mentions going to Fuqua for free beer.
