Scott corrected the contract numbers and the cumulative imbalance for Valero Sprayberry to approximately -620,000 dths on the Gas Plan sheet. Sherry asked everyone to review the points, imbalances, and totals, especially Oasis, and to ensure the numbers are accurate before the morning meeting. Scott is already addressing the imbalance issue at Oasis, and the team needs to confirm the corrections with Dale Ratliff today.
