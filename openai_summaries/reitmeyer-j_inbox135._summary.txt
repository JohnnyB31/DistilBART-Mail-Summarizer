The email thread discusses the new procedure for notifying stakeholders about the approval and commissioning of capacity segments for Medicine Bow. Laine Lobban states that they will notify when each segment is filed with FERC and upon approval, which is anticipated to take about 4 days. The contract start date will be the later of two days after FERC approval, four days after filing, or at least one week after the last in-service date. Laine provides an example with specific dates and mentions early capacity availability at a certain rate. The sender also notes they will be out of the office Wednesday and returning Friday, and offers a cell phone contact.
