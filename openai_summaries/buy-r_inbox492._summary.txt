The email thread discusses clarifying how to categorize commodity groups for Board reporting, specifically whether they should be labeled as core, non-core, or under review. Cassandra suggests reviewing a list of commodity groups and confirming their categories, possibly with Whalley or Greg. Paula agrees and recommends confirming Rick's comfort and consulting Greg if needed. The goal is to customize reporting based on these categories, which impact trading results and may be discussed at the upcoming Board meeting.
