Meg and Jerril are shopping for Christmas gifts, including sleeping bags with animals for Reagan and Madison, and "Little House" books. They discuss what Lauren needs and whether Jenn and Jay want a gift certificate or something for their new house. Meg mentions planning to get chairs for the patio and possibly clippers for Dad. She is also transferring a nurse from her practice and is feeling calmer. They are going to Fredericksburg for a 3-day weekend.
