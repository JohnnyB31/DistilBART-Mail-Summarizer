The contract #47 between VNG and TENN was lost in November, and Brenda is asking Steve if any capacity was released under this contract during that month. She also notes that there is no deal in Sitara for November with a demand fee, and if a transport fee needs to be paid, a new deal must be set up. Brenda requests to be informed as soon as possible.
