The email discusses the status of the Section 16 list of officers and whether the Board needs to approve or ratify it. Rex plans to call Rick to discuss if Rick's title or responsibilities have changed, the relevance of a Chief Risk Officer in Chapter 11, and the status of the Executive Committee. There is a BOD meeting tonight.
