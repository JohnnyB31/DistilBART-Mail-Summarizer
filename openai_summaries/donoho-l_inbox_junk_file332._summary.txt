The team is working on creating the substance of the TW Business Plan before finalizing its presentation. Tracy is waiting for Michael or Davis to add assumptions and financial data from the updated model. Lindy is expected to help with drafting, especially while Tracy is out for surgery. Gina Taylor's group may be working on a draft of the text version of the presentation, but this has not been confirmed. The file "BUSINESS PLAN OF TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY.doc" is involved.
