The email thread discusses a local Visual Basic class scheduled for December 3rd, which is about to be canceled. Michael Schilmoeller recommends the class, noting he has taken a similar course and found it excellent. He asks colleagues if they are interested and inquires about potential costs and how many participants might attend. Tim Heizenrader and Holden Salisbury are asked if they or their teams are interested in signing up or providing candidates.
