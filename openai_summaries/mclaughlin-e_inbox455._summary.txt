Patrick noticed that Errol changed the volume of an EOL trade from 2,500/day to 5,000/day. Errol mentioned that if the trade was with Virginia Power, Chris Chang in settlements disputed the volume and they agreed to change it; otherwise, Errol asked to be called. Patrick asked for clarification on the reason for the volume change.
