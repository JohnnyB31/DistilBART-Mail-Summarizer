The team is planning a conference call in the morning to discuss the CPUC protest response. Maria provided additional comments and questions on the draft answer, which Bill and she might discuss with others. Maria also noted that as of today, IS has not filed a protest. The preferred times suggested are around 9:30 or 10.
