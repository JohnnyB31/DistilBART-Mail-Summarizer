Reliant's traders are hesitant to participate in sleeve trades without conditions, and some are unwilling to discuss certain activities. Presto suggests conditioning all "free" sleeve trades on future trades with Reliant, such as requiring a minimum number of trades or charges if not met. Bill Bradford advises speaking with Presto to facilitate these trades and mentions avoiding AEP. An external contact notes that PJM traders won't participate without a spread and ERCOT traders won't discuss, but mutual credit management and new potential deals are ongoing.
