FERC is deliberating on various agenda items. They approved two key orders: one to modify the June 19 Price Mitigation Order by setting the price cap at $108 until April 30, 2002, and linking it to natural gas prices; and another to deny most requests for rehearing on California Orders since December 15, 2000, while requiring the California ISO to submit revised congestion management and day-ahead market plans by May 1, 2002. The orders passed with 3 votes in favor and 1 against.
