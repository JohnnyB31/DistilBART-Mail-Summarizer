Kevin Howard mentioned to George McKean that they agreed to proceed with the Northern Border Partners Common Units. George noted no update yet, expecting news on a two-week extension around Tuesday and a final decision in early December. They discussed not selling the units even if proceeds are trapped, to avoid hurting bargaining position, and agreed to wait until they understand their situation before making public announcements.
