The email thread discusses attending the Aeros game on Friday night at 7:30. Kim Erb mentions that her family and others are going to the game after practice because the kids received tickets for good grades. She also offers four additional tickets she found through work to Gina Hemphill and her family, asking if they would like to use them.
