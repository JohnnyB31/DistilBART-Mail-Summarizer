The email thread discusses the termination notices from Wabash Power, GPU Energy, and Ameren, with confirmation that Wabash's termination is effective December 19, 2001, and GPU's effective date is likely January 21, 2002. There is a question about whether to serve GPU through January 21st due to a favorable contract in PJM. Edward Baughman is verifying if there are any one-off contracts and whether the Wabash termination notice covers all transactions.
