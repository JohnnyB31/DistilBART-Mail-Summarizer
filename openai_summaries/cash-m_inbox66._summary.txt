The Coal group plans to acquire four marketing employees from Vulcan if they purchase the marketing rights, with these employees expected to resign from Vulcan and be offered positions at Enron. The purchase will be for an 18-month to 3-year trial period, after which Enron may return the rights to Vulcan and wants the right to recall these employees. George McClellan agrees to the recall right, but it is unclear where to include this in the legal documents.
