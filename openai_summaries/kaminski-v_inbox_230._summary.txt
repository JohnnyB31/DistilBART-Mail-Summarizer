Vince is informed that the demand curve for June-July may be heavy due to extensive review of international assets in August. Cindy requests updates on monthly curves for the Brazil office, including FX, IGP-M, CPI, PPI Finished Goods, and PPI Industrial Commodities, as these will be needed for revaluing assets before the August BOD meeting. She asks Gwyn for the status of these curves and mentions preparing a list of needed curves for upcoming months.
