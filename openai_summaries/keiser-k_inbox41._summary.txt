Doug asked Cora and Kam to update the deals #1192611 and #1193243 in SITARA to reflect PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation. Kay responded that she believes the deals should be with PG&E Energy Trading and that she stopped using the previous counterparty after realizing a mistake in December. Kay thinks Cora or Cam fixed it last month. Doug is seeking confirmation on whether the deals should be with PG&E Energy Trading or PG&E National Energy Group, Inc.
