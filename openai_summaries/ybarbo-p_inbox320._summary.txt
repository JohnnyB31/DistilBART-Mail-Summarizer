The email thread discusses the required heel volume for the LNG vessel to ensure readiness for the next loading in Qalhat on July 5. Captain Bentzrød suggests reducing the heel to 3,200 m3 or possibly increasing it to 3,600 m3, to balance safety and loading efficiency. Dan Masters requests an estimate of the heel volume needed and emphasizes unloading as much as possible at Lake Charles on June 9, while ensuring the vessel can reach Qalhat on time.
