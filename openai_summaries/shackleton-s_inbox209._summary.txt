Tanya emphasizes that the transaction must be carved out of the CSFBI master to avoid margin issues, as Enron receives fixed 150MM upfront and pays it back at the end, making the deal out of the money for Enron. The swap with MSCG is at the money and may require margin posting without receiving any. Treasa and Raj confirm they will call Tanya to discuss, and Tanya will be out of the office tomorrow but back on Monday.
