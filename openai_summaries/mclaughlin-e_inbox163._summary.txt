The email thread discusses setting up and updating a book request (# B-DEC19-4-ST-5). The setup was added as a tab to the bankruptcy post ID sheet and initially configured as MMBTU/USD in Risktrac. Cecilia changed the book's units to GJ/CAD, which has now been fixed. Susan requested Bernice to set up the book and notify when complete, and she mentioned she will be out of the office on December 20-21, asking others to handle ERMS tasks in her absence. She also noted that the books had already been set up in RisktRAC and apologized for delays caused by Outlook issues.
