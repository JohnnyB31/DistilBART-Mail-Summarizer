Chris Abel requests Kam Keiser to email the gas DPR sheet to him and mentions setting up another export process later, replacing East and West with US. Kam reports that all in-the-money financial counterparties and physical deals are included, and will update additional columns for tomorrow's report. Chris asks for clarification on the 7,849 BCF figure, whether it represents all of ENA Gas, and if the shortfall from 11/30 has been addressed. Kam confirms the gas DPR will be sent on Wednesdays and Mondays, and asks if this format is sufficient. Canada Gas has not yet provided their part.
