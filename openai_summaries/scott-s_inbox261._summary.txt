The Wyoming Interstate Company (WIC) will have one unit out of service on October 30, 2001, for about 8 hours, reducing throughput to approximately 360 MMcf/d. Theresa asks Jackie and Shelly to call Adele to determine how much Medicine Bow capacity will be affected and to ensure the difference is sold at Glenrock into KN. Dinah advises contacting your marketer to confirm gas delivery capacity on that day, as allocations will be based on WIC's methods.
