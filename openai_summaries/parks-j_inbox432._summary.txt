Louis and Ed discussed the Entex Early Termination Document, with Ed making edits and highlighting areas for review. Louis confirmed that Entex agreed to the terms after talking with Rick Miles, and they are waiting for final approval of the $2.05 price/dth for storage inventory. The document will be forwarded to Kay Mann for approval routing. The early termination is subject to bankruptcy court approval and attorney sign-off.
