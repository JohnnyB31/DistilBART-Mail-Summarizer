The team plans to dry pig the San Juan Lateral, re-evaluate its efficiency, and possibly re-apply the DRA in April/May. They will also install new equipment on the Ignacio line in the fall. Efficiencies are currently low, and further inspections are needed to estimate impacts on budgets. No outages have been scheduled yet.
