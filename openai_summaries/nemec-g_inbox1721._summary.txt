The team is responding to an RFP from Frito Lay for a full-requirements gas supply contract in California from Dec 2001 to Oct 2003. Kim Ward is handling the negotiations, which include executing a GISB with special provisions and a confirmation form. There is a concern about the "Adequate Assurances" language related to "title to the Gas," which might imply the gas supplier could be required to post collateral. The response must be submitted by noon on November 15, with all modifications included.
