Elizabeth inquires if anyone recalls situations where TW structured GRI contracts differently, as she is unaware of such cases. Rita explains that TW changed GRI handling in 1998 to avoid remitting GRI on discounted reservations, increasing margins, but the impact has decreased over time as GRI rates declined from $.0066 to $.0018. She notes that in some long-term contracts, TW keeps the GRI when rates are below maximum, but revenue drops as GRI decreases. She asks for estimates of potential losses due to GRI rate declines and whether any contracts are affected.
