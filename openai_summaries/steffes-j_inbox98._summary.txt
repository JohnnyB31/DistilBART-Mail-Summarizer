Jim reports a potential credit crunch in NEPOOL due to cancellation of Surety Bonds and mentions that November 2001 bills are due in all markets on Dec 20, 2001. Dana suggests the best people for support are Teresa Allen, Rebecca Grace, Stacey White, or Casey Evans. Jim and Christi are trying to work out payment plans and need support understanding payment obligations and bills, and they are seeking contacts for each market.
