The team reviewed DASH classifications and agreed that three categories are sufficient, with "Proceed," "Returns Below Capital Price," and "Do Not Proceed." They discussed replacing "See Other RAC Comments" with a more forceful label like "Issues - Sr. Management Approval Required" and removing it as an official category. They found 36 DASHes with the "Proceed - See Other RAC Comments" recommendation since 1999. The team can quickly implement these changes in the DASH template and library.
