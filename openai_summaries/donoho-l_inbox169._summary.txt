Rod Hayslett is requesting electronic copies of files that back up revenue projections from 2001 and 2002, and possibly 2000, as he only has hard copies. Michelle Lokay is unable to access the shared drive, and Rod asks for help from Jan Moore and others to obtain these files and email them to the relevant addresses.
