The team discussed and agreed on specific SIC codes for ENA/EES, including adding categories like Refining, Grain and Meat Processing, Cement, Auto, Aerospace, Heavy Industrial Equipment, and Paper Manufacturing. They decided to exclude Glass and certain other categories due to existing outsourcing or deals. Baughman is negotiating with Archer Daniels Midland for a 300MW grain processing load, and Luce has deals with meat and grain processors. The group plans to ask for more detailed categorization, mainly for the US, and will include additional industries as suggested.
