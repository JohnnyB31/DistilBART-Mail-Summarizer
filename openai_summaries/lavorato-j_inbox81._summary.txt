Per and David want to meet with John Lavorato early next week (Monday or Tuesday) to discuss the unit contingent call option (CCO) product and its importance for Enron's power desk. They attached a summary of this year's activity, market changes, and strategy for 2002. They confirmed successful management of the CCO portfolio and mentioned declining reinsurance coverage in favor of derivatives. David's summary has been modified for the current situation. Per will schedule the meeting based on John's availability.
