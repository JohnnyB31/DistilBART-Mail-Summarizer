The team plans to meet this morning after 9:00 to discuss older receivables, including a list of outstanding receivables prior to December 2000 with a total value of $11,783.70, which Frank has requested to be written off to clean up the books. Raetta is working on resolving a missing entry of $1,406.01 and will coordinate with Jean Blair for the writeoff forms. Rick will confirm the meeting time afterward.
