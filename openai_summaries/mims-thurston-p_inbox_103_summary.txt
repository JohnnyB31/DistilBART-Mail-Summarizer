The email thread details a scheduled conversation on April 10 regarding AOS gas communication timelines between Enron, BP, and Crestar. Key deadlines include 8:55 MCT for Gerry Kurtz to call Elizabeth Bartnes about AOS volumes, 9:00 MCT for Gerry to inform Mark Schrab about AOS flow and shares, 9:45 MCT for Mark to email BP and Crestar with destination details, and 10:30 MCT for BP and Crestar to nominate supply volumes to Alliance. Enron is not obligated to accept nominations if deadlines are missed, and each party is responsible for charges if they fail to meet their respective deadlines.
