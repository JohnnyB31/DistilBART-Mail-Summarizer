Dorie is trying to find out what charges were applied to John's American Express after a bill at Barton Creek, which was split three ways. John mentions an additional $800 charge on his Amex, possibly related to an extra room that was canceled and resold. Dorie has a call into her Barton Creek rep to clarify the charges.
