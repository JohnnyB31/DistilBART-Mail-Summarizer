Bill Rapp is handling Northern Natural's compliance with the marketing affiliate rule due to recent personnel changes at Enron. Andy Fastow, previously in a position satisfying the rule, needs a replacement. Cindy Olson has been suggested as a possible replacement, as she is neither an officer nor director of a marketing affiliate or Northern. Maria Pavlou questions why Andy was originally used and asks if they know who the replacement is. The team is seeking input on whether to proceed with Cindy Olson as Andy’s replacement.
