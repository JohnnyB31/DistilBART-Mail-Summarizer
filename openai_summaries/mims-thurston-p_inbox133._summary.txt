The windfall outage has been extended to 44 hours, making the AOS estimate for the 7th 0%. All shippers should stay with their current plan for the 6th gas day, with no drafting allowed on the US side. Alliance will plan the gas day with receipt stations in place, and nominations should proceed up to contract capacity. They will keep everyone informed of any changes.
