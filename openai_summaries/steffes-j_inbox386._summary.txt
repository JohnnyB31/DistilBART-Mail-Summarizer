Sarah and colleagues are reviewing draft RTO comments prepared by Sarah, reflecting EPMI's views on RTO development. Tom Hoatson commended Sarah for addressing concerns about PJM and state commissioners, and suggested referencing the Cardell study for the northeast and addressing ITC's, including the hybrid-RTO proposed by New England. The team plans to submit comments by Monday and is coordinating reviews among multiple stakeholders, including Kevin and Tim.
