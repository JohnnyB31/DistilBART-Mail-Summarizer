Laura provided Tom with an updated list of remaining vacation hours for Texas Desk traders, including details from SAP and corrections for vacation taken between November 1-15. She noted that Dave's vacation time is not in SAP yet, but he has 8 days remaining. Laura also mentioned she will correct Dave's vacation in SAP. Tom requested this information because many traders want to use their vacation before year-end.
