TE is expecting mild weather and decreased demand during the holiday weekend, which limits their ability to absorb gas. Starting May 26, 2001, all shippers must ensure physical receipts do not exceed deliveries, with no makeup gas scheduled unless through the Operations Account Manager. These restrictions will last through the holiday.
