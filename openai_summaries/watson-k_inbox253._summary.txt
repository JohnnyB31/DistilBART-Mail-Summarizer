Questar canceled part of its Southern Trails pipeline project in California due to state regulations making it uneconomic to operate that section. The California portion, about 300 miles, is unlikely to be brought into natural gas service, and Questar is seeking alternative uses or a buyer. The pipeline from the San Juan Basin to Southern California is scheduled to open June 1 next year, but the capacity at the border and potential new operators will determine if any supplies reach California.
