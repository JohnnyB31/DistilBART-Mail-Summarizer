The meeting with Stan on 2/6/02 at 8:00 am is a strategy session to discuss assumptions for the 2004 rate case and a ten-year plan. John will bring the 2002 Plan, but it is a short-term plan, and Rod does not want it distributed. They assumed a rate drop effective 1/1/05, and John wants to review the assumptions behind that. Teb asked if they were going to meet today, but Rob is out on Wednesday, and Teb suggests calling him on his cell.
