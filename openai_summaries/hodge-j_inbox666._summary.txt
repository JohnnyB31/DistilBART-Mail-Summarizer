The FERC rejected Texas Gas Transmission's request to use GAS DAILY pricing for cashouts and advised to disregard previous cashout info. TGT submitted a new proposal to use weekly averages and change tiers, aiming for retroactive implementation from October 1st. Several entities oppose this tariff change, so the final cashout method is uncertain. Jeanne Wukasch will inform stakeholders once FERC approves the new methodology.
