ENEL is preparing to respond to Tennessee's South Texas Expansion before the deadline of 5:00 pm, with a binding agreement due by Thursday, November 29th. Ruth discussed with Julie Smith that ENEL should submit the open season response and sign Tennessee's PA to avoid credit issues. The Rio Bravo IV Open Season has been postponed to December 7, 2001, giving ENEL about a week to work on their proposal. Additionally, Tennessee Gas Pipeline mentioned that another international company has submitted an Open Season response.
