PNM has a 10,000 Dth PNR balance parked at Rio Puerco since April 26, 2000, on contract Cr# 27267 after PO# 27190 expired. PNM has not nominated or inquired about redelivery, and TW has not billed fees since May 1, 2000. Michael Bodnar instructs Laura Giambrone to remind PNM to nominate the gas out promptly and verify that imbalance statements continue to be sent to Sally Prentice. TK Lohman agrees PNM should get the balance out without additional charges. Sue Neville recommends PNM nominate the balance when convenient for TW and questions procedures to prevent future issues.
