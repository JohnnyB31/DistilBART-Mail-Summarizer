Kimberly Watson's team will need their own access to the LIM/MIMIC database starting February 1, as some current users will no longer be available. Julie McCoy is coordinating to ensure access for Kay Treat and Sean Bolks. T.K. Lohman currently uses LIM on his desktop and may be a resource for Kimberly's team. Kimberly is considering whether to request access for her team and will coordinate with Julie.
