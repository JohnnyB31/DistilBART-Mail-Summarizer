Kimberly asked Lindy how many operating agreements she has. David clarified that he was not waiting on Kim and listed agreements that are no longer on file, mainly for La Plata and Blanco Hub. Kim thanked David and asked if he needed all San Juan and Thoreau contracts, offering to send the rest. David mentioned he lost a contact last year that could help obtain agreements for certain customers and asked Kim to send the contact's name.
