The email discusses a follow-up to a meeting about Citizens' comments on a service agreement with EAMR. Enron will work with Citizens to create an insurance policy covering both Citizens and EAMR, costing $5,000–$7,500, paid by ENA. A side letter will be signed to cover the premium. EAMR is willing to sign the services agreement once Citizens agrees to EAMR's indemnity and liability terms. Attached documents include Citizens' comments, the original draft agreement from January 15, 2001, and policy details.
