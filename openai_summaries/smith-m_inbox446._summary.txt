Steve asked Matt if he is using regionID 2 for California in the forecasting model. He explained that regionIDs 5, 6, or 7 (NP, SP, ZP) do not produce results because California is not broken into those subregions. Matt inquired whether California data has a different scenario ID, as the results for California are missing from the MOD_Load table for scenario ID 25 (New Model).
