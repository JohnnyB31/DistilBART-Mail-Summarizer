The All Employee Meeting was streamed using a new web-based platform that was still in development, causing some performance issues. The Internal Communications department has not yet released the original video and has no ETA for its availability. Dan Dietrich is collecting interest from employees to view the replay and will inform them when it is accessible. He also plans to meet with technical teams to improve streaming performance.
