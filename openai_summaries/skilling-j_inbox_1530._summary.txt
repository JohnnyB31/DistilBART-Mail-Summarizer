The draw request for Jeffrey Skilling has been received, but it is missing signatures from the borrower and the architect needs to certify the G702 application. Additionally, Change Order #25 for $29,297.51 is required, and a revised draw request including Change Order #28 for $80,978.49 is also received. An inspection will be ordered.
