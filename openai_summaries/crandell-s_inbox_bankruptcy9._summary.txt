CRC contacted us on December 21 to resume deliveries at Mid-C. The legal team confirms this is acceptable, noting that contracts signed before December 2 are pre-petition and deliveries under those contracts are also pre-petition. Some counterparties, like EPE, may prefer to continue delivering despite payment uncertainties, as they might be better off delivering rather than terminating. We cannot guarantee payment to these counterparties, and they must assess whether to deliver or terminate based on their own calculations.
