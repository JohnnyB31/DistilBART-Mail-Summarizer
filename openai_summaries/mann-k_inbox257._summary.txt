Robert asked Neil if he knows the associated traders for the contracts. Neil replied that the longhaul trader can help. Robert requested Neil to send the contract numbers or explain the contracts to Danny Clark so he can gather them. The contracts listed include details like counterparty, capacity, deal number, status, circuit, term, and MRC. This is needed ASAP for selling the Portland MAN.
