Ben Jacoby has prepared a payment direction letter for AES regarding the Haywood deal, which directs AES to pay $100,000 to their consultant and the remaining $2,010,000 by check. He asks Kay Mann to review the attached letter and confirm if they can proceed, with the expectation that funds will be received late next week.
