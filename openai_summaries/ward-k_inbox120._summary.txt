Megan is working on invoices for Pasadena, including the April 2001 invoice, which will be paid via wire transfer of $1,853,770.40 on 11/30/01. She needs negotiated prices for El Paso capacity from May onward, as well as El Paso deliveries, Kern River deliveries, and nomination emails from Pasadena for each month. Kim Ward suggests offsetting future invoices due to the large amount owed. Megan has sent May and June spreadsheets for review and is awaiting responses.
