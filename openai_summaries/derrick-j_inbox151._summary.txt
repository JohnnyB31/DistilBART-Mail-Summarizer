Heath informed Jim that the support for Xcelerator is ongoing and not urgent, as the team is already working with an EWS attorney on the main issue. Jim is on the road and will be in the office tomorrow, and Heath asked to be called. Heath also noted that due to Whalley's promotion, Xcelerator will stay under Corporate instead of moving to EWS, and asked if Jim wants support from Mark Haedicke's group or someone else. Heath wants to discuss the company's ability to compete with another company later in the week.
