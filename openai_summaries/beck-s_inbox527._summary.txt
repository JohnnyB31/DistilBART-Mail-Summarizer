The email thread discusses issues with ERMS books not being included in RisktRAC, resulting in a total volume difference of approximately 3.4 million barrels. Wanda Curry highlights that Todd and Shona are working to reconcile positions and identify omitted books, which may be limited to VAR, with CreditAg reporting credit exposures. She suggests dissecting the problem to understand its scope for Project Green Light and asks about the duration of the omission, impact on V@R, total volumes not reported, and reasons for omission, possibly related to portfolio hierarchy. Burton McIntyre provides a list of specific books not entering RisktRAC.
