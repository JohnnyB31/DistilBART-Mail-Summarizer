Pamela is coordinating the relocation of Dave Neubauer's office from the 39th floor to ECN1354. Julie has requested and received approval for the move, which should be scheduled after Linda Wehring returns from vacation the week of October 19th. Pamela will set up the move request mid-next week and check with Linda on Monday for additional input. She also plans to outfit ECN1354 with VP style furniture beforehand to avoid moving furniture twice.
