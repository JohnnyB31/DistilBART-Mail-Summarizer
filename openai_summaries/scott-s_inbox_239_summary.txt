Heather has been to Baba Yega recently and is interested in trying La Vista, which she has not heard of before. Lisa and others are planning to meet at Yvette's at 6:30 for Saturday night, with options including Baba Yega and La Vista. Lisa offers to pick up Heather's T-shirt and suggests going to the SSK House at 8 am, asking Heather to email her if she wants to join.
