Michael bought a house in SouthBridge built in 1996, with an expected close in the third weekend of June. He is starting inspections and appraisals. He mentioned going to a band night called "Rock on the Dock" and had a dinner at Willie G's. Beth asked about the house's cost and location, and Michael confirmed the house was accepted and still needs inspections and lender approval. He also invited Beth to listen to a band at Kema tonight.
