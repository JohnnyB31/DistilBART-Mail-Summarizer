The DART product development is progressing after completing two major projects. The team is working on identifying DART deals, which requires research. A new DART product has been created and is in testing, and the Build Route Reports need to be revised accordingly. The update is expected by Wednesday, and the change will be scheduled after completing the current high-priority project.
