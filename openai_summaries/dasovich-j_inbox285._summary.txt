The email thread discusses the appointment process of the CPUC President. It confirms that the government, not the Senate, chooses the CPUC President, and the Senate only consents to commissioners' appointments. There is mention of legislation giving the Governor appointment power, but it does not grant the Senate advise and consent rights. Additionally, Burton stated that Loretta is the only President he will support, implying the Senate's approval is necessary for her replacement.
