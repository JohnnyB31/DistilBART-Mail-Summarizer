Brenda Herod is organizing a lunch with Eric, Timothy, and Dave. Dave is available tomorrow, and Brenda and Mr. Hull are also available then. She asks if tomorrow is too early or if they should plan for next week, and requests everyone to let her know. The lunch will be paid for by one of the UBS people with bonuses.
