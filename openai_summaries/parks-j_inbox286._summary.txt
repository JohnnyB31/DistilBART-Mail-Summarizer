The team is working to improve EES price, basis, and index position data. Scott Mills provided detailed information, including separate tabs for different deal types. Louis DiCarlo requests a discussion with EES Risk to clarify the data in PV'd versus nominal form, especially for NYMEX hedging and basis positions. Maria Garza is checking whether ENA Price positions are PV'd or nominal, and a meeting will be set up with Risk, ENA, EES, and key stakeholders to agree on methodology and conversion factors before including basis in hedge calculations.
