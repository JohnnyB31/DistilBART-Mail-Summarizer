The email thread discusses a 1-part rate problem with PNM K# 27606. TK Lohman indicates that PNM's invoice should be fixed after Laura re-paths the contract. Craig Buehler asks Laura to re-path the contract so the system recognizes the 1-part flag. Jan Moore reports that Dennis changed the flag last week, which should now generate a credit for the commodity. Craig then notes that although the deal is flagged as 1-part in CBS, it isn't creating a credit, and he asks for ideas.
