The email discusses the Partnership's Bank of America line of credit, which is now available at $112k as of May 25, after recent repayments and fund transfers. It also covers a $2,535,786.72 repayment from refinancing two homes, used to pay down the personal LOC. The Partnership borrowed $200,000 from the personal line to cover a cash call for SRE properties, leaving an estimated $25k-$50k available. Additionally, there are plans to invest in the BBT Fund with initial amounts around $250,000 from the personal line, $100,000 from KLL & LPL Investments, Ltd., and possibly $100,000 from the Foundation, with a funding deadline around July. The Foundation is considering an Offshore Partnership to avoid UBIT taxes.
