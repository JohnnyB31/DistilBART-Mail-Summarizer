Patrice Mims is asking if Fannette Perry is still at the company and if Ora Cross has seen Jewel Meeks, who has lost a lot of weight. Ora confirms Fannette has been gone for almost a year and is in real estate. Ora also mentions seeing Jewel and that she attributes her weight loss to medical reasons and prayer. Patrice is also going to the Dance Theatre of Harlem tonight with Angie and wonders if Jones Hall is fancy. Ora congratulates Patrice for checking her emails.
