Steve is trying to find out who is in charge of fuel procurement for Nevada Power. Lorraine previously spoke to John Olenick, who was against further FT due to deregulation. Lorraine also mentioned that no one at Las Vegas Cogen has been approached directly. Southwest Gas's largest customers are power plants, including Nevada Power and Las Vegas Cogen. Parties planning or building new power plants in Southern Nevada include Mirant, Reliant, Calpine, PG&E, and APS/Pinnacle West. Lorraine is still trying to get a name and number of a person in Las Vegas and will check on another contact.
