Lori asks Tana if there are changes to the managers for Enron Net Works LLC because many business units are removing Derrick and Whalley to comply with the marketing affiliate rule. Tana asks Mark Taylor, who states Net Works is not a marketing affiliate and they can make changes if desired. Tana is not aware of any changes. Lori asks Tana to let her know.
