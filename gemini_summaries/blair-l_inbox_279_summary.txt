Joe Williams wants to discuss the Hobbs System and get a firm commitment before volunteering a mechanism to get gas from the Altura point and will call Gary Spraggins. Gary Spraggins suggests scheduling gas directly to Golden Spread POI-71395, but Golden Spread would have to agree to flow the gas on a 24-hour basis. Sherry Forbish reports that Oxy Permian is interested in increasing their capability to flow more volume and has included estimated costs in their budget for processing plant capacity increase in Q1-Q2 2002. They are also talking with Mustang, but Mustang doesn't want to pay transport. Sherry has visited with Dynegy, who expressed concern regarding frequent allocation of the Hobbs System. Joe and Sherry are passing this information along for consideration.
