Molly Harris is concerned about increasing collateral requests from utilities like Socal, NIMO, and BGE. Mark Valvanis from BGE has notified Enron that no future enrollments can be processed until additional collateral requirements are met. Harry Kingerski can follow up on this issue with Mark Valvanis. Rolf Ramelmeier is asking for the appropriate parties to forward the BGE collateral issue to.
