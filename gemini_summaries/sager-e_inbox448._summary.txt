Christi is building a spreadsheet of agreements for a Newco Power Marketing Company. She attached a spreadsheet and asks recipients to use the current EPMI contracts as an example. Several individuals are assigned specific areas to work on, and Christi requests their updated spreadsheets by COB Wednesday. Jim Steffes is to include his thoughts on Eastern gas as Christi left him off the initial list. Christi and Susan will divide the rest of the spreadsheet, and Bob and Harry could help with pools Marcus has not done. Christi will proceed from there.
