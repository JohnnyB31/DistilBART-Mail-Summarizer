Meg found sleeping bags for Reagan and Madison, and will also get them "Little House" books. Meg is asking Jay and Jenn what Lauren needs and what they want for gifts. Meg will get either the clippers or chairs for the patio based on their decision. Meg is firing one of her nurses and is going to Fredericksburg next week for a 3 day weekend.
