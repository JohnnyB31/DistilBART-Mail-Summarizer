Visit Phunnarungsi is having trouble estimating the mean reversion rate for Queensland electricity spot prices using a Geometric Brownian Mean Reverting Jump Diffusion Model. Les Clewlow suggests that the issue may stem from regressing the lagged return instead of the leading return. Visit has tried both half-hourly and monthly data, and the results are consistent with a positive slope, preventing him from estimating the mean reversion rate. He requests advice on this matter.
