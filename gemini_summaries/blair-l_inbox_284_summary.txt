A meeting is scheduled for Monday at 3:30 PM in 49c2 to discuss the Alliant measurement issue, specifically the inability to provide daily NNG measurement readings, which is frustrating NNG customers and the NNG marketing group. Ellis will be on vacation on November 26th but Gary will be attending and is well-versed in PD measurement. Charlie Thompson has been tasked with developing a five-year plan for automated equipment to address these situations.
