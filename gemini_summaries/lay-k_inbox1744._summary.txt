Aaron S. Nyirenda of Zambia Power Rehabilitation Project requires Enron's contact information urgently for the TD 98 transformer contract. Enron International was shortlisted, but the transformer component was removed and packaged separately as TD 98. Invitations to Tender are about to be sent, and a feedback from the relevant person is required today.
