Carl Sulzer is looking to lock in gas for May, June, and July of 2002 and asked Darron Giron to check with traders for price quotes for 1,000 per day at Ventura. Carl talked to Brian Frihart on Friday and purchased 3 fixed forward contracts at $2.895. He would like to purchase more and wants to talk. Darron was out of the office on Friday and will call Carl later this morning with a quote.
