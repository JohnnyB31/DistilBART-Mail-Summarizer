Andrea Yowman attached a draft document titled 'Enron Diversity Overview' for the CEO Diversity Roundtable preparation. She requested updates from owners of different areas to have the document updated by their 2:45 p.m. meeting. Michelle Cash provided feedback, suggesting that "governmental relationships" may not be "compliance" and proposed renaming it "HR Risk Mitigation/management" instead. Andrea plans to incorporate Michelle's points and fine-tune them tomorrow.
