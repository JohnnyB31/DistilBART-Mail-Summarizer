Caroline Barnes is following up on an inquiry from Tracy Geaccone regarding TW's UAF gain for January. Debbie Mosely mentioned a high gain in February. Caroline informed Tracy that someone would email her and Steve Harris about the UAF gain for TW. Ellis Stern is also involved and will add Steve Harris to his weekly report, in addition to Tracy Geaccone. Steve Klimesh has added Tracy and Steve to a distribution list and will forward meeting notes. Caroline is asking who is leading the investigation and if the practice of receiving monthly UAF updates has stopped.
