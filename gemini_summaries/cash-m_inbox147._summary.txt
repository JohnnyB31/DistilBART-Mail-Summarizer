Jeff Lewis is concerned about his investment in the cash balance plan, as he is close to vesting and has turned down other job opportunities to reach this milestone. He has over $18,000 in the plan and is only 6 days away from vesting. He asks if anything can be done about his situation, especially since payroll may have already run with the new information. He requests a call or reply as soon as possible.
