Dennis's team is preparing to test a new contract system for Transwestern, which is scheduled to go into production in Q1 2002. They need to make changes to TW's tariff to allow for electronic contracting, similar to what was done for FGT's tariff. Jeanette has discussed this with Dennis and confirmed that TW's tariff already has language for electronic contracting for capacity release. Jeanette is asking Teb what he wants to do and if they should duplicate the Florida language. Dennis is asking Teb if a meeting is needed or if he can proceed.
