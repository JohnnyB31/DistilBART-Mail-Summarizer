Mary Kay received a protest from CPUC regarding the USGT transaction starting Nov 1, 2001, concerning market power, pricing, volume, and market-based rates. She expects a similar protest from IS. Mary Kay and Maria are working on an answer to the protests, and the FERC should issue an order by the end of November. Kim asks about the usual process, response opportunities, and protest timelines. The volume on this transaction is 400,000 per day.
