Michelle Cash received a call from Kristen Kracraft of Dynegy requesting a protocol for hiring employees between Dynegy and Enron. Michelle has asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on this protocol, with David Oxley and Andrea Lang making decisions. Kristen also mentioned that someone in Rick Shapiro's group wants to move to Dynegy, which Michelle believes should be handled with extreme caution. David and Andrea will discuss this further tomorrow.
