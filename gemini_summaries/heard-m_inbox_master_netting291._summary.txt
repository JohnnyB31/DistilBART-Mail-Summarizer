Brent is working on a second draft of the Master Netting Agreement, which includes recent updates. He has also forwarded a spreadsheet outlining contracts and GTC's to Jay, and has asked Jay to find the credit contact at El Paso to put pressure on them to review the draft document. Brent anticipates that many contracts and GTC's will need to be amended to modify specific provisions. Marie has requested an update on the agreements from the recipients by emailing Carol, Mary, and herself.
