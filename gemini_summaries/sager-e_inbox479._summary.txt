Christi Nicolay received invoices from MAIN region for 2002 assessment. She does not know of any Enron positions that would warrant payment for "Enron SE past due" or "EPMI past due". She is asking for clarification on whether Enron should pay these invoices and if they could create issues for Newco. Nicolay has also forwarded the information to other recipients, stating that these invoices could create issues for Newco if Enron is an owner. She is requesting to be informed of any Enron physical positions that would justify payment.
