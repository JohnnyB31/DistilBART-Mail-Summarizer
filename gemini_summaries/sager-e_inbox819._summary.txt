Justin reviewed the USG Coversheet and is seeking confirmation from Tonya/Lisa about specific clauses. Christian indicated a "no new counterparty" mode and suggested checking with credit before finalizing agreements. He also mentioned they are not going to sign any agreements until management approval and that they should continue low-key development of agreements. They plan to discuss this at their upcoming legal-credit luncheon.
