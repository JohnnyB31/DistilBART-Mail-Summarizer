Julia Murray and Carol St. Clair reviewed Chase prepays and found that if S&P downgrades below investment grade, the collateral threshold will be reduced to zero. Mary Perkins advised that there are no monies on deposit with Chase, and they were told there are no outstanding Citibank prepays. Julia will have all the pieces pulled together this afternoon.
