Rick Carson proposed a new DASH classification system, suggesting to replace "Proceed - See Other RAC Comments" with "Issues - Sr. Management Approval Required". This change is due to 36 DASHes approved since late 1999 with "Proceed - See Other RAC Comments" that had substantial issues. David Gorte agreed with Rick Buy's sentiment that a decision must be made and that three categories are sufficient. Carson also suggested using "See Other RAC Comments" as a footnote and wants to eliminate it as an official category. Carson states they can make changes instantly.
