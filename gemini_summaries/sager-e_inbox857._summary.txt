Bonnie White received a call from Robert Minkoff on Friday, 11/09, whose company is interested in purchasing EPMI's claim in the PCA bankruptcy. Bonnie is unsure if EPMI still has a claim as the adversary was settled about 6 months ago. She asked Elizabeth if EPMI still holds a claim and if they are interested in selling it to a claims broker.
