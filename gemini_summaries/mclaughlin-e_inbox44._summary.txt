Regan Smith announced the next NETCO test will be on February 4th and 5th, correcting a previous date. She also informed employees that new corp IDs will transfer to UBS on Sunday, limiting start menu access. Smith asked NETCO employees if they need to retain an estate ID for support during the last week, as exceptions require authorization. She also asked participants to review the attached list of names and test schedules for the regression test, which will focus on EOL deals, EnPower/SItara/TDS deal entry, and include global setup, deal entry on Monday, and downstream, Unify, SAP on Tuesday.
