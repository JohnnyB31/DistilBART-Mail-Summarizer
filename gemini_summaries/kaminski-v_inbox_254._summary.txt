Frank is confused about PCA and asks Tanya to explain it. Louise Kitchen wants the correlations implemented today. Tanya explains that they need to increase the number of factors and do joint factors analysis. Frank asks Bharat to run correlations using the last 60 days of pricing, log returns, and then calculate correlations. Frank also suggests using the heat rate to calculate correlations. Bharat sends a file named GAS PWR.xls.
