Ed wants to schedule 10 minutes to adjust Kimberly's Business Objects installation to the new ETS Marketing standard. Ed is available except between 14:00 and 16:00 on Tuesday. Kimberly apologizes for not connecting sooner, as she has been very busy and asks about Ed's availability in the morning and evening and if she needs to be at her desk. She will make time for him. Ed sent instructions in an attached file.
