Pam Butler questions Michelle Cash on the amount for a separation agreement, noting the company was to pay for an apartment through April 30, 2001. Pam suggests this be removed as the tenant was asked to vacate in May. Pam also inquires if Mary has adjusted a $350,000 lump sum payment to account for outstanding expenses, resulting in a net payment of $119,495, and if the tenant agreed to reimburse Enron for tax advances.
