Suvarna has sent the Petition filed in court today in three parts to Suhas: Index & Synopsis, Petition, Vakalatnama, M/A and List of Document, and Exhibits (A to O). Suhas is forwarding a soft copy of the WP (Lodging No.1376/2001) as filed before the High Court and believes it would suffice instead of scanned copies. Paul Kraske is imagining White & Case wants to review this and is asking Robert what he thinks about sending a hard copy or emailing it.
