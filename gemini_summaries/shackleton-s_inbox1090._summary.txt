Tom needs to amend the Bear guaranty to cover ECT Europe Finance, Inc. and free up cash. He left Sara a voicemail and is waiting for a new contact from London. Sara is asking for the credit approval person's contact information to follow up on approvals and account status.

There's also a question about whether Enron Corp. has provided guaranties for brokerage accounts in the past and if ECT Europe Finance, Inc. is a 100% owned subsidiary.
