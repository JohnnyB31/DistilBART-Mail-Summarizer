Bill Rapp is sending a draft letter to the CPUC regarding SoCal Gas's proposed changes to "windowing" criteria and requests comments by the end of today for a filing tomorrow. Lindy Donoho is hesitant to mention "Shipper imbalances" and suggests referring to "customers" instead. Terry Kowalke agrees with Lindy and provides a suggested restatement of a paragraph to address "Shipper Imbalances."
