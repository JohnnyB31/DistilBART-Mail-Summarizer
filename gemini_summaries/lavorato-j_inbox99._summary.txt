Jean Mrha is flying to Buffalo, NY for Thanksgiving. Julie Gomez will sign on Jean's behalf for LRCI Inc. for the sale of Napoleonville Land. Texas Brine has been informed of a premium bid of $3 MM. Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to changes to the "Act of Sale" document, which Gerald Nemec is reviewing with legal counsel. The land is expected to be sold, potentially at a higher auction price. The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM. Eva Rainer is also an appropriate contact.
