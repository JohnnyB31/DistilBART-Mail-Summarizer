Ken Rice received a call from Dr. Tom Limperis, who developed a system he wants to show Enron. Ken wants Vince Kaminski to return the call because he has a PhD in computer science. Vince agreed to return the call, and asked Dorothy Dalton for Tom's number. Vince is available before the Full Requirements meeting today, or after the EGM meeting on Monday. There is an all-employee EGM meeting at 3:30 pm.
