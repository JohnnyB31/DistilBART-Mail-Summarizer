NNG has billed MEC for October 2001 charges related to DDVC and IT overrun. Accounting indicated that MEC's metering does not show these charges. Tom has asked Accounting to short pay the DDVC charges ($26,374) and associated transport invoice ($29,704.52) due to a total disputed cost of $56,078.52. Frank needs to verify the measurement of all stations, as Bill and his SCADA folks believe untelemetered allocations are inaccurate. Chrisman confirmed the billing details and reiterated that MEC is shortpaying these invoices.
