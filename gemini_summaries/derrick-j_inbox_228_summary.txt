Ed Cattigan is proposing a settlement for a Delay in Start Up claim, amounting to $750k out of a possible $901k. He has been negotiating this for nine months and believes it is acceptable given the circumstances and advice from external counsel. Ed requests advise on whether to accept this sum as full and final settlement and asks Sophie to confirm the wording of the acceptance notice. Ed would like to complete this by Wednesday, his last week. Adam Overfield fully supports the settlement as outlined by Ed. Alf Bodimeade has no problems with the figures.
