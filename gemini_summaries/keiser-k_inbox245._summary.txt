Carl Tricoli forwarded Harlan's schedule of termination dates for TXU and requested MTM values be calculated and forwarded by the end of the day. He also requested a short meeting for tomorrow to discuss the values and plan next steps, with Tina Holcombe to send out a meeting time later today. Carl Gossett asked for an update on where they stand. Harlan indicated the next step is to clean up items on an attached spreadsheet, assign a value to each contract, and plan for factoring in LDs with the MTM exposure.
