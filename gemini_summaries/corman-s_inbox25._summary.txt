Shelley is building spreadsheet cases for cash-out analysis and needs to reconcile net volumes and break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances. Shelley has made changes to Galen's spreadsheet and needs Jim's sheet to identify large differences. Shelley is planning to apply majority/minority pricing only to market area imbalances and needs to get a final analysis to Teb by the end of the week.
