T. Lucci received an email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services stating that Forest Oil and AEC have been instructed not to sell to Enron. This is a concern for Enron as these counterparties account for a majority of their transactions. T. Lucci is trying to close deals with Karen and feels close to success. Karen also suggested meeting for a drink after work.
