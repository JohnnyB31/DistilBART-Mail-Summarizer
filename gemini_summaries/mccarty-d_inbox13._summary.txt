Shelley Corman provided Rod Hayslett with a summary of TW/NNG revenue by counterparty for the 12 months ended 9/30/01, totaling $180.6 million in transport revenue. This information has been furnished to Kevin Howard. The difference between Corman's numbers and Tracy's reported gross operating revenues of $200 million for TW is primarily due to fuel sales. The open question is how this data can be reconciled to financials. Shelley's staff worked late to compile the report, which was of interest to Danny McCarty.
