Henry Terech Jr. and Lance McCarthy of Enron Property & Services Corp. have asked a developer to submit a proposal for a new 45,000 SF service center at Beltway 8 and Clay Road. Enron will purchase the land and finance the project, with the developer managing design, construction, and development. The developer has submitted a preliminary budget and will follow up with a formal proposal next week. Robert Duncan is eager to get Jeff Skilling's approval for this deal.
