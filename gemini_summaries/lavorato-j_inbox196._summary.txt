David Oxley is creating a list of employees to receive bonuses, considering factors like their role in bankruptcy, critical business functions, and other job prospects. John Lavorato inquires about Beck's list and if it includes IT or power scheduling. David plans to gather names and proposed numbers for Greg this evening, and he will be available at his office to discuss the list. The logic for selecting employees is outlined, focusing on those critical for navigating bankruptcy, core business operations, retaining lights, and managing complex deals.
