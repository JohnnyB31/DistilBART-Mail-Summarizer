Chris Calger spoke with Rogers about the renewables function. Richard Ring will set up a book and cover short positions in the East. Elliot and Richard should work together. Elliot's objectives should be to transact through EES or with wholesale parties. Rogers is focused on covering his short position. Stacey Bolton provided an update and is working closely with Elliot and Richard. Product descriptions are being created for customers, and generators are being worked with to list RECs on EOL.
