Kevin spoke with Richard Jordan at SWG about Phoenix ROW and El Paso F/R contracts. Richard indicated that if the FERC staff recommendation for F/R is accepted, SWG will need substantial new transport capacity. Regarding Phoenix ROW, SWG is considering taking the 8-inch line out of service and conveying it to Enron for Sun Devil in exchange for transport capacity. Kevin stated they would stay in touch with SWG as things progressed with SD.
