Tim Johanson needs to discuss storage issues with Lynn Blair. Tim spoke with Steve Sweeney at Cogentrix, who wants to see data for June 1, 2001 - September 30, 2001. Steve is getting impatient, and the discrepancy must be explored. Tim said they will resolve it. Tim recommends he and Kent Miller meet to discuss their offer to Cogentrix.
