Judy Lay Allen, an associate of Jeff Skilling, spoke with Joannie Williamson about Michael's desire to interview. Michael is in Houston through Friday and is available for interviews on Thursday or Friday. Billy Lemmons Jr. met with Michael and recommended scheduling him for additional interviews, though he has a schedule conflict next Wednesday. Joannie Williamson noted that Jeff Skilling is travelling for the next two days, and Michael is in town and wanted to meet before his departure on Friday, asking if either Billy or Traci could meet with him. Michael is familiar with the industry and has worked with clients in telecommunications, and is aware of Enron's bandwidth trading/pooling field. His resume is attached.
