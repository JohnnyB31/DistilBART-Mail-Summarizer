Cora Pendergrass announced that starting November 1, Nicor Hub contracts will be processed using CPR exchange tickets, a change from the current EDI process. Marlo James is seeking assistance to resolve issues with Nicor/Northern Illinois Gas deals, which are causing significant financial discrepancies ($4 million receivable, $1.1 million payable). James has a tariff document from Nicor effective July 15, 1999, showing storage and transportation capacity, which contradicts previous information received from Sylvia Campos. James is willing to provide a copy of the tariff and requests any assistance to clear these outstanding amounts.
