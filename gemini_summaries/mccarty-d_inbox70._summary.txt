Mike provided Jean with a breakdown of the costs for TFT flat panels, totaling $12,250.00 for the first request and $4,200.00 for the second. GSS is still working on the cost of plasma panels, which Mike will provide as soon as possible. They do not yet have court approval to sell the panels, but they can "loan" them and "square away" the cost once approval is gained.
