Ken Lay waived his $60 million change of control payment that would have been triggered by the merger with Dynegy. He decided to waive the payment after talking to employees and will continue to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders, wanting to restore Enron. Brent Vasconcellos commended Lay for this gesture.
