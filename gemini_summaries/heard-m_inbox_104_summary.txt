Maureen Ryan of Chase sent Sara Shackleton a proposed amendment to the Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement (IRCEA), as discussed with Phil Levy. The amendment modifies the definition of "Specified Swap" to include foreign exchange transactions. Sara is asked to review the amendment, arrange for its execution, and fax a copy to Maureen. Maureen will then return one fully executed original to Sara.
