Stephanie Piwetz is asking Sean Crandall for information on Portland General deal 713660.01 because Diana is out of the office. Stephanie previously asked Diana to check details of the deal, including that Enron sells PGE 400 MWS at $56.50. They can handle the deal on Monday if Sean doesn't have the information.
