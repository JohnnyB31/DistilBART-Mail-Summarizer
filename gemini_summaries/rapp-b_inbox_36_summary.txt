The Color Laser Printer in Denise's cube is now running. Recipients need to delete the old printer icon and add the new one by following the provided instructions. Lee has already had the new printer added to his computer. The printer can print on legal-size paper in black and white/gray. Users must manually change the paper cartridge to legal for legal-size printing and change it back to letter afterward.
