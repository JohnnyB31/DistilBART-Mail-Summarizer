Goldman Sachs/J Aron inquired about entering into a Master Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement for US and Canada gas trading. While willing to enter into a Master Agreement, they would prefer not to use a GISB, opting to work under GTCs until the Master is finalized. They have also asked about using a GISB to replace the GTCs. Jeff is requesting clarification on past master agreements.
