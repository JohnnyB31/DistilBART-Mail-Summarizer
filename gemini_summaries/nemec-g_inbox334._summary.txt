Gerald contacted Carlos Pena regarding the Mojave TPA, and they agreed that Section 3.2(B) and a specific sentence on page 10 should be stricken. However, Section 3.2(B) in the main body should not be stricken as Exhibit A overrides it. "Enron North America Corp." should be inserted as the full legal name. Shahnaz informed Gerald that El Paso and Mojave TPAs were initiated by Karen, and she has asked Karen to send a revised copy.
