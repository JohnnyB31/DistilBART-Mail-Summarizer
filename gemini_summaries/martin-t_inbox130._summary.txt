Tom provided details on the Texas Desk EOL Product Rollout Schedule, with Phase 1 on January 21st and Phase 2 in February. Dave asked for clarification on the dates for Phase 1 and Phase 2. Tom confirmed that January 21st is a holiday, so the launch of NetcoOnline is planned for January 22nd. Dave noted that minimal notice is needed for products previously on EnronOnline and inquired about lead time for any product changes between Phase 1 and Phase 2.
