Sarabeth Smith provided a summary of the deal structure with Citizens following a meeting. Enron will work with Citizens to secure an insurance policy for EAMR. The policy cost, between $5,000 and $7,500, will be paid by ENA and not revealed to Citizens. ENA will also enter into a side letter with EAMR for the premium payment. EAMR will execute a services agreement with Citizens once the insurance policy is agreed upon, provided Citizens accepts EAMR's indemnity and liability terms. H. Foster forwarded this email to Barry Tycholiz.
