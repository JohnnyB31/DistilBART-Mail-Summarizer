Steven January confirmed that the valve to the Farmer's Ag Hancock, Minnesota corn dryer (POI 78110) was opened. He outlined the procedure for shutting in the valve when Benson pressure drops to 350 psi or less, emphasizing that communication should be with specific individuals and logged, and that this customer is interruptible. Joni Bollinger provided a contact for Farmer's Ag (Chad Lozinski) and suggested contacting Eric Rodenburg at UCU. Joni also mentioned that Mitch Olsen, NNG field tech, will test communications with a UCU representative on 9/10, and the valve cannot be turned on until everything is confirmed.
