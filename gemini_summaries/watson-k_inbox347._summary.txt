Kimberly Watson needs LIM/MIMIC database access because Kay Treat and Sean Bolks will not be available starting February 1 due to the Dynegy situation. Julie McCoy will forward the request to Lorna Brennan to ensure Kay and Sean retain access. T.K. Lohman currently utilizes LIM on his desktop, and Julie is asking if he could be a resource or if access should be requested for another party.
