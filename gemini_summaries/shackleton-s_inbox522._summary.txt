Kelly Summers informed Laurel Adams and Sara Shackleton about a new UBS Internet Module for "Verbal Confirms" on FX trades. UBS requires setup with IDs, passwords, and a signed contract. Max Squire is the UBS contact who will provide more information. Kelly finds the system interesting and can ask Max to send the paperwork for review. Valerie Lambelet from UBS enclosed information and a URL for the confirmation tool.
