Kay and Barton are working on Austin Energy. Barton learned that the desk has a power deal with the City of Austin in default. They should meet with Jeffrey to formulate a response to the City's letter. Stuart suggests keeping arrangements separate, as Sandhill is not a debtor and is an asset/commodity. Jeffrey will have the accounting spreadsheet from Theresa Vox today.
