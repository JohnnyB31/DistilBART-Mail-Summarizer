The NYISO will post the ICAP Stage 2 manual with a new timeline for the Winter 2001/2002 capability period. Market participants involved in UCAP auctions must complete new Purchase and Sales agreements and have a NYISO assigned "Registrant Name" and "Password" to submit monthly certification forms. A link to a similar timeline is provided. Bob Boyle or Marie Pieniazek can be contacted with questions.
