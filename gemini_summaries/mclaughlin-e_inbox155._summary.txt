Errol McLaughlin will run a minibook for Eric Boyt on legs 9 and C after hearing back from Canadian book admins. Leg B terminated on 06/30/1999, and legs 9 and C are in Canadian books. Errol had already left a message with the admins. Eric previously asked for a re-run because he thought legs 9, B, and C were missing on the JP swaps.
