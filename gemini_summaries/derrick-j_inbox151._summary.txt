Heath informs James that the Xcelerator will remain under Corporate, not move to EWS as previously expected. Heath asks James if he should continue requesting support from Mark Haedicke's group or approach someone else in Corporate. Heath also wants to discuss their ability to compete with another company by the latter part of the week. James, currently on the road and communicating via Blackberry, will be in the office tomorrow and asks Heath to call him. Heath confirms that the team is already working with an EWS attorney on the most pressing issue, so it's not time-sensitive.
