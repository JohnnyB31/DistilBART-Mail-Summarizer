Andrea Yowman sent a draft document titled 'Enron Diversity Overview' for the CEO Diversity Roundtable. She requested updates from owners of various diversity efforts, expecting them by a 2:45 p.m. meeting. Michelle Cash provided feedback, suggesting a rebranding of "compliance" to "HR Risk Mitigation/management" and adding related compliance points. Andrea will incorporate Michelle's points and fine-tune them tomorrow.
