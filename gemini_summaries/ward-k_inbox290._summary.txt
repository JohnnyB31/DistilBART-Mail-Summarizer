Kim asked Anne to book accrual origination for June, July, and August 2001. Kim also asked if Anne was the correct person to inform about John Cogan's payments and inquired about past payments. Kim stated she would have September's payment ready today or tomorrow and October's by the 10th, and attached supporting spreadsheets. Anne confirmed that everything on Kim's list is complete and that John Cogan has been paid each month, with payments now caught up.
