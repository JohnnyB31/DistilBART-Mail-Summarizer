Laura discovered a 10,000 Dth PNR balance for PNM on an expired contract. Michael has asked Laura to remind PNM to nominate the gas off TW and to verify where imbalance statements should be sent. Sue suggests not charging PNM additional fees and implementing a procedure to prevent future balances. TK agrees PNM should get the gas out.
