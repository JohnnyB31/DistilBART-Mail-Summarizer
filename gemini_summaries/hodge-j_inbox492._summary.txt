John Ale is seeking legal review of the proposed Dynegy merger structure. He wants to understand if a structure where Enron is not the technical survivor impacts change-of-control provisions, as the surviving company would automatically assume Enron's obligations. He has requested responses from Rob Walls, Lance Schuler, Joe Henry, Peter del Vecchio, and himself.
