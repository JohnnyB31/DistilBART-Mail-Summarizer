Lynn Blair informed Delaine Kurth from Oneok that an OBA would be drafted on Wednesday with month-to-month cash out language. Delaine said she would run the contract traps. Lynn also stated that if an agreement could not be reached, the current methodology would continue. Meanwhile, an Accounts Receivable issue of approximately $99,000 with Oneok has been identified, and Rick and Robert have tried to resolve it with Oneok, Kinder Morgan, and NNG. This issue may need to be resolved before agreeing to an OBA. Karen Brostad is asked to draft the OBA.
