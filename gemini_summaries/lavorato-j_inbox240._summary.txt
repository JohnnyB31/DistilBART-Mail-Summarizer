Larry Pardue is proposing to dissolve Enron (UFEN) Regasificadora Ltd., Enron Dominicana LNG de Luxemburgo S.a.r.l., and Enron Dominicana B.V. by November 9, 2001, as these companies are no longer needed after the Union Fenosa JV fell through. He is requesting approval from the recipients, including Coralina Rivera, to proceed. Coralina confirms there's no reason to keep the entities but asks Larry to confirm with Ken and D. Shields, and also inquires about the transfer to UF. Larry explains the companies are costly "shelf" companies and reiterates his intent to dissolve them before year-end, mentioning one group wants to retain Enron Dominicana B.V. He plans to send a company-wide "Notice of Intent to Dissolve" to allow for any objections.
