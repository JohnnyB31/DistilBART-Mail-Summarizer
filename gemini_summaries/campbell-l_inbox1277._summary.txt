Mike Riedel is trying to locate Larry Campbell's signed final evaluation, which Anabelle Torres stated could not be found. Larry Campbell's evaluation was faxed on December 19, 2001. Mike tried to contact Larry without success and will try again on January 2, 2002, if the evaluation is still missing. The deadline for delivery to Bill Kendrick was December 28th, and individual and team performance will be communicated by January 15, 2002.
