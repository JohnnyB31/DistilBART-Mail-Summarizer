Adriana needs the final GSA to forward to Jode Corp. The tasking letter can only be processed once the GSA is executed and language is agreed upon. Kay asked Adriana if she has considered the tasking letter to wrap up the contract. Kay is not bothered by the commercial comments. Adriana will process the contract once she receives the executed GSA from Jode.
