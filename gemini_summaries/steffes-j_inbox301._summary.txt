The NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published an article on November 19, 2001, stating that the EIA is preparing to take over the AGA's storage survey after the winter. The EIA's plan needs OMB clearance and could take several months, with an expected schedule release in early December. The AGA has stated the report will be discontinued at the beginning of January.
