Tom Moleski from PJM informed Richard Drom that Morgan Stanley requested to change the end date of transaction 23454 to "immediately". This change, approved by Enron, will result in a 35 MW deficiency for Enron, incurring a penalty of approximately $570,000. However, Richard Drom later learned that the 35 MW is actually in excess of Enron's obligations, meaning Enron has no need to act to avoid deficiency penalties. He apologizes for the false alarm during the holidays and advises calling Tom Moleski for more details.
