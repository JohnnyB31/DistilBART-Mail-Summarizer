Jodie Floyd received a call on 11/13 from Bill Lindley of Clayton Energy regarding DDVC penalties. Bill is asking if actual daily volume allocations at POI 60551, Meter Number 722015-01 were estimated. Bill requested that the chart(s) be pulled and the reading checked to verify penalties and daily volume for October. Gary and Jodie discussed this, and Gary will have Frankie pull the charts and input daily volumes in PGAS for comparison to see the impact on DDVC penalties. Bill has provided daily readings from his check meter for comparison.
