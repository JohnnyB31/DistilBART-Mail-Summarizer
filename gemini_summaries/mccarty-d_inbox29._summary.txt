Julie Armstrong is following up on a TV monitor that is not functioning. She was out of the office Friday and did not see anyone come by on Thursday to check the situation. She is requesting an update on the cable and wishes to resolve the issue in a timely manner. Pamela Daily is still trying to find a smaller TV on a cart.
