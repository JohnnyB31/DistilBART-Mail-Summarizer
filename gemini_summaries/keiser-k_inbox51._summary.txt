Kam needs access to EOL by Thursday for testing. Tom states that access will be granted soon by Stephanie, who will send IDs and passwords. He emphasizes that EOL is a new production database, not for general testing, and that restricted users are authorized for testing and cleanup. The plan is to copy the UBS production database to the test environment and resume bridge testing from there.
