A preliminary report recommends limiting the inlet pressure to Citizens "Griffith Plant" Station to 740 psig. Some reviewers are on vacation, delaying finalization. Martin Conboy is creating a log of events for the station's operation, which Robert Franson will send later today. Franson asks David Roensch to review the log to ensure nothing is missing before agreeing on further changes. Ray Kelm had to delete figures from the report to email it.
