Craig contacted Jan and Elizabeth about a 1-part rate problem with PNM K# 27606. Jan stated Dennis changed the flag last week, and it should now create a credit. Craig then asked Laura to re-path the contract/invoice so the system will pick up the 1-part flag. TK mentioned the invoice should be fixed after Laura repaths it.
