Sherry asked everyone to review the Gas Plan, specifically focusing on points, monthly, and cumulative imbalances. Scott is addressing an issue with the Oasis point, where the cumulative imbalance is reported as -620,000 dths, which seems incorrect. Terry advised contacting Dale Ratliff to correct the numbers today, as Dynegy will be reviewing this high-profile item. Gary and meeting attendees need to be kept informed. Scott has since corrected the Oasis point to reflect the proper imbalance and has fixed switched contract numbers for tomorrow's morning meeting.
