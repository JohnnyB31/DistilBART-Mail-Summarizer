Sally Beck has called a meeting for today at 3:00 PM to discuss curve validation, which Arthur Andersen will be reviewing. Bob Hall raised a concern that EOL trading has slowed down, making it difficult to get prices for the curves. Sally hopes to give assurances about progress to Shawn Kilcrest and Tom Bauer later this week. Attendees who cannot join the meeting should get with their risk leads to be aware of the current status and improvements needed.
