Laurel Bolt is helping Ed Baughman negotiate a final settlement with PSEG. PSEG wants to finalize this by tomorrow or early next week. Laurel needs the final November and December numbers for Fin and Phy gas, Fin and Phy Power, and Emissions. She also needs the MTM value for all January 2002 and forward emissions, gas and power deals. Errol Gossett needs to run a mini-book and get back to him as soon as possible.
