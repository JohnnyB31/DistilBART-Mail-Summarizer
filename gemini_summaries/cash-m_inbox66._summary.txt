Michelle Cash inquires about employment agreements for Vulcan employees acquired by Enron in a deal for marketing rights. Shanna Funkhouser explains that these employees would resign from Vulcan and be offered positions at Enron. Enron's purchase is for a trial period, after which Vulcan may recall the employees. George McClellan approves this recall right, but Shanna is unsure how to document it.
