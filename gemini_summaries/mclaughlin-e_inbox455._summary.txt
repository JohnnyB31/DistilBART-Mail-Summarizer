Patrick asks Errol why the volume for an EOL deal was changed from 2,500/day to 5,000/day, as the trade data in EOL reads 2,500/day. Errol, who is on vacation, states that if the deal is with Virginia Power, Chris Chang in settlements handled it and agreed to change the trade due to a volume dispute. Otherwise, Errol can be called at 713-870-8211.
