Raetta contacted Loren and Larry because Post Rock has not signed their extension agreement and has not paid invoices from Nov 2000 thru March 2001. Randy Janzen and Harry Woodson were going to call them today. Craig mentioned that Post Rock thought the agreement had a one year term, but it was amended to 5 years. Craig believes Post Rock considers the deal terminated and asked if they are nominating. Larry or Loren is the Account Manager for Post Rock and should be able to assist. Raetta needs help from Marketing to get the extension agreement signed.
