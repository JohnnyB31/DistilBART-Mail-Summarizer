Philippa asked Bob if he had copies of the signed BETA agreement for Norwegian Energy Brokers AS and First Energy Brokers AS. Bob stated that the document was signed and sent last Friday, and it needs to be forwarded to their Norway office for signature. Once signed, a copy will be forwarded to Philippa, who will then be requested to give the clients execute status on specified products.
