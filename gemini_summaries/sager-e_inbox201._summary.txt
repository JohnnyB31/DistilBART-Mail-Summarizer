David Burns sent a suggested UCC1 financing statement for New Power, noting that Tax ID numbers need to be added and that it needs to be determined if New Power is a transmitting utility. He asked for views on the facts or this issue and requested to be notified when New Power might need a quick turnaround on these documents. Barbara Carney attached the relevant documents. Lisa Mellencamp stated that they have the documents and are waiting to hear about the schedule, which is probably tomorrow morning.
