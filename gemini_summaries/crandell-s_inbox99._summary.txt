Fran Chang is following up on the DART product development status. Bill Crooks has completed a higher priority project and is now working on DART. The EOL IT group has created a new DART product in testing. Fran requested that Bill's group revise the Build Route Reports and provide a timeline. Bill indicated they will need to research identifying DART deals and will schedule the change after completing the higher priority project. An update is expected on or before Wednesday.
