Hunter asked Robert about a meeting with lawyers. Robert's meeting with UBS attorneys went well, and they are looking to set up contract services for pipes. The contracts are non-negotiable. A follow-up credit meeting is scheduled for today. UBS wants to do a credit review of the pipes, and Robert provided a list of Day 1 pipes for them to start their process. Robert believes there will be no challenge entering into these agreements. The credit issue is significant, and they need UBS to expedite their review. Suzanne is attending a legal meeting today to discuss the current status. Robert will forward any additional information he receives. This is contingent on the Power of Attorney issue being settled soon for contract execution.
