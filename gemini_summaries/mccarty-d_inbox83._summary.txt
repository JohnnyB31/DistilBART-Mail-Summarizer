Julie updated Danny on accomplishments, noting two contracts approved by Craig Buehler. HR made a mistake with termination letters, and many people received them, which halts savings plan contributions. Julie will send out a notice to direct reports. Dave Neubauer inquired about Northern, and word is out that Citibank is ready to proceed on a Trading deal. Danny was working out when Julie called, and she spoke with Ben about his Christmas gift. Dave sent a summary of 2001 accomplishments.
