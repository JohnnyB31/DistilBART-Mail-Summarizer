Charles Yeung has updated the ERCOT Balanced Schedules paper by adding an executive summary, removing repetitive arguments, and retitling section headings. Luiz Maurer is OK with the simplifications but wants more explanation on a graph. Maurer will not contact Larry Ruff until he hears from Yeung and Nicolay. Maurer is available today and tomorrow.
