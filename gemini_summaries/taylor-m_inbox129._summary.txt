Diane Anderson states that Dutch Quigley has spoken with Greg Crowley and Cecile Taylor-Simpson, and they have agreed that Enron should be the confirming party for EOL deals. Diane asks if they can revise their Master Agreement to reflect this change and suggests it as an opportunity to get Chase to execute the EOL Amendment. Sara Shackleton notes that the EOL list is attached and that Chase merged with JP Morgan and they need to upgrade/select an existing master. Mark Taylor asks if anyone is working on a no-confirms agreement for Chase and states that Diane and Anne Koehler are listed in Lotus Notes on this matter.
