Tara contacted Jason to inquire about his well-being and ask questions about Enron. Jason replied, stating he had just returned from seeing the new building. Tara then asked Jason if he knew the difference between Origination, Structuring, and Transactions, as she received an offer to return to Enron and these are areas associates rotate through. She mentioned she would write more later, but was heading out for "free beer" at Fuqua.
