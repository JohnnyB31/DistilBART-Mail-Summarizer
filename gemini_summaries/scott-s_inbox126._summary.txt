Randy Hardy sent Stewart Rosman a DSI Chart matrix showing Northwest Aluminum Direct Service Industries (DSI's) discussed during a September 7 meeting. The chart can be used in an October 8 meeting to discuss potential DSI candidates for Enron services. Mike Grigsby forwarded this to several Enron employees.
