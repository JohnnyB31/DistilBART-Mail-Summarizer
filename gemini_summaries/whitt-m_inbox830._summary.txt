Kam has taken Anne Bike's place as manager of the West risk desk. She is loading the Natural Gas Prices reports onto a website so they can be accessed daily. Kam needs NT login IDs and email addresses to grant access, and asks recipients to reply with this information and any questions. Mark has thanked Kam and looks forward to working with her.
