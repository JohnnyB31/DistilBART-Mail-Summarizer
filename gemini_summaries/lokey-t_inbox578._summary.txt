Rachel received a price quote for a Gas Daily Table package. She wants to know if she should sign up and who the designated user should be. Shelley suggested setting it up for January 1st and recording charges to the balancing tools account. Shelley will also check with Sheila about Galen or Jim Studebaker. Rachel has left a message for her contact at Platts.
