Louisville Gas & Electric (LG&E) is preparing a hedge plan using call options, which is considered a financial deal. The Public Service Commission is expected to review the proposal soon, possibly this week. Clay Murphy, Chris Balmer, and Pam Jaynes will call Craig Taylor on Tuesday to discuss the plan, provide feedback, and address concerns before sending out bid letters. They have attached a draft bid letter and the General Terms and Conditions for call options, asking for review and distribution. Jeff Hodge was forwarded the material and has asked Mark to assign someone to get in touch with Craig.
