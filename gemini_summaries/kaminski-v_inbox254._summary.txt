Frank asks Tanya to explain PCA, but supports it if correlations can be improved. Louise Kitchen wants it implemented today. Frank had Bharat run correlations using the last 60 days of pricing and log returns. Tanya suggested increasing the number of factors for term-structure of correlations, which Frank wants to discuss further. Tanya provided an example of low correlations between NG and west power curves and attached a file with GAS PWR.xls.
