CFACTS has filed comments on RTO West's proposals for congestion management and access charge pricing, which are part of RTO West's March 1, 2002 Stage "2" FERC filing. CFACTS believes the current proposal discriminates against nonincumbents and provides few incentives for existing contract holders to convert.
