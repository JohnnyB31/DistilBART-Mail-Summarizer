Andrew House attached a revised draft of the Writ Petition, which is in its final form. He will arrange for final edits and reformatting to be done by Wednesday morning, and expects to forward the final version to Bombay by 8:30 am Bombay time. DPC needs to insert figures into the draft. The reference to the PPA has been removed as an exhibit to avoid making the petition bulky.
