Britt is handling three insurance claims and wants to send a request for extension of time tomorrow or Monday due to vacation schedules. Existing extensions expire December 31st. Sharron West asked that all requests be submitted at once. Britt also mentions the problematic Enron Petrochemicals claim and had to file a third-party action against Baytank. Britt invites everyone's comments. Gary attached a letter to Sharron West for Britt's review.
