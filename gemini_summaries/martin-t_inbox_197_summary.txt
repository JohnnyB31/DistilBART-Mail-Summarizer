Jim Schwieger informs Brian Redmond that Bammel has 20.3 TBTU of working gas and estimates another 3+ TBTU will be injected by May 31, 2001. This could result in AEP owing Enron around $98 million, due by June 1, 2001. Brian suggests notifying AEP of this amount during their meeting this week and developing a process for future updates. Brian also asks Tom M. to discuss the June bid week deal approval process with Jim, which Lillian is arranging.
