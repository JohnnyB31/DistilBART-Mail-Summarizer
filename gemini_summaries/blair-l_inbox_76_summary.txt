Randy Janzen is updating the Bushton Balance for October 26, 2001. He talked to Steve in NNG Gas Control about a volume discrepancy and confirmed the measurement in PGAS. Randy will meet with Harry, PGAS, and TMS in the morning to resolve an issue between these systems and asks recipients to disregard the previous Bushton Report for the 26th.
