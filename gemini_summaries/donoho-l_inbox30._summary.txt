Greg Porter spoke with Georgetta Baker and Rick Miles about mediation for the TW v. SoCalGas case. They agreed to begin with mediation, with Rick Miles as the mediator. Both parties indicated a willingness to settle. Initial meeting dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered, and a neutral location needs to be agreed upon. Greg Porter will advise once additional information is learned.
