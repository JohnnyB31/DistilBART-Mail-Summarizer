Mike and Keith discussed making the Gas Fundies meeting a weekly event, starting at 3:00 PM, with all parties dialing in. Mike also requested the meeting room be cleared and handouts emailed beforehand, and an itinerary sent weekly. Jay stated there would be no formal rockies fundies today because he will be in the air, and a general discussion with Frank and Steve will work for this week. Mike asked Jay to coordinate the format with Keith.
