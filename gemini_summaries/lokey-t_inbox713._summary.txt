Liz is trying to verify if Jeanette Doll is still on assignment and needs Teb to validate cost center numbers and company/department information. Liz also asked about a tentative end date for the assignment. Teb confirmed Jeanette is still on assignment indefinitely and Debbie Thompson will respond regarding coding. Liz needs to know if the end date should be extended for 3, 6 months, or through the end of 2002, and will wait to hear from Debbie on the coding.
