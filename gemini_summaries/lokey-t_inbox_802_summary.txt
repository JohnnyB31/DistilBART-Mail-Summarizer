Sheila is looking into a supply imbalance of 211K from Tejas in December, as estimates may have been used for actual flow. The check meter is not working. Tim is following up with Tejas to find the actual December flow. They are also working to cover payback imbalances. A new process is being implemented to ensure scheduled quantities are tied out monthly. Shelley is concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance and asks for a breakdown of current month portions. She suggests capturing payback gas use against the project if it's a result of Phase V outages.
