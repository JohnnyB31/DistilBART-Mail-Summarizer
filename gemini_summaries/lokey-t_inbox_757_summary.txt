The Red Rock weekly report indicates that Stations 1 & 2 will be in-service mid-June 2002 and Station 3 in July 2002. Kelly Allen suggests that TW can use existing capacity for incremental RR volume until the stations are in-service and that TW should consider filing an amendment if their schedule slides. Lorraine Lindberg asks if shippers should be informed yet and if they should utilize existing space for the Oneok deal to avoid revenue loss.
