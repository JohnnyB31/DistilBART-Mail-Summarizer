Juan is looking for volunteers to work the holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years) and has asked for vacation requests for November and December. Michael would rather work Christmas than Thanksgiving to watch the Aggies and would like to take off Nov. 2-5 and some time around Thanksgiving. Michael is also scheduled to work Sat. night Oct. 27 and would like to take a vacation day that day if possible to go to Vegas. Michael is not particular and will work if needed.
