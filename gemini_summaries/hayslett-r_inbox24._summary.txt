Shawn requested a baseline assessment of Enron's social and environmental risk from business units by Thanksgiving. Lisa is unsure if she should work on this request as her 2002 risk assessments with Andersen are in January, but she could touch base with Lou Soldano and Don Hawkins. James agrees that a preliminary assessment can be done through Lou and Don for environmental risk but questions what social risk is.
