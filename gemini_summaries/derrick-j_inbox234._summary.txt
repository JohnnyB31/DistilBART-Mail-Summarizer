Ed Cattigan is seeking approval to settle an outstanding Delay in Start Up claim for $750k, which is 83% of the possible $901k. He has been negotiating this claim for 9 months and believes this settlement is acceptable to ENS, especially given external counsel's advice. Ed is requesting confirmation from recipients by Wednesday, as it is his last week. Heath-Lambert is assisting Ed and appears to agree with his approach. Sophie is asked to confirm the wording of the acceptance notice.
