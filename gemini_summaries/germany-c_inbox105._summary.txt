TE Pipeline Conditions will have limited ability to absorb due-shipper gas into the system this weekend, effective May 26, 2001, due to mild temperatures and decreased demand. TE is requesting all shippers ensure physical receipts do not exceed physical deliveries. These restrictions are expected to be in effect through the holiday weekend.
