Steve is waiting for instructions from Carol regarding contacting Florida Power & Light for a Master Netting Agreement and to receive a new Master Netting Agreement form. Marie reminded recipients not to use the previously sent form, and a new one will be sent later today. Steve also requested a copy of the Issues List.
