Stan wants a presentation run-through for the Lay reviews on November 1st, to be held in EB 49C2. John may have to change his plans as he is scheduled to be in Korea. John previously submitted a budget of approximately $2 million through Steve Kean's group and $300,000 for Gina Taylor's group. John will identify reductions and will inform Tracy when details are needed. Tracy also informed John that Rod suggested he might want to sit in on this meeting.
