The Enron Net Works infrastructure team, led by Mike Croucher, is gathering requirements for common data for NEWCO. They need assistance from key individuals within each business unit and request a list of potential assistants. Bob Hall is seeking more details before assigning people to a task force, noting that most people will be unavailable in the next two weeks. Stacey White is inquiring about the approach to this task. No deal-specific or counterparty data can be transferred to NETCO.
