Megan Parker has taken over the Pasadena account and is working on invoices from April forward, with the April 2001 invoice and calc sheet attached. Enron plans to wire Pasadena $1,853,770.40 on Friday, 11/30/01. Kim Ward inquired about offsetting future invoices if Pasadena owes them money. Megan has sent May and June spreadsheets to Patti for review and is awaiting feedback. Megan needs negotiated prices for El Paso fixed capacity for May forward and is still in need of El Paso deliveries, Kern River deliveries, and the nomination email from Pasadena for July forward.
