John Toews received a call from Bob Bradly, representing Vern E Falkner, who needs to discuss a pipeline tie-in in Hansford County, Texas. Bob Bradly's phone number is 405-842-4334. John attempted to contact Earl Chanley and Richard C Johnson via phone but was unsuccessful. Earl Chanley is following up with marketing and has contacted Mr. Bradly for locations and volumes (200 mcfd, possible compression, line TG385, three wells, location WCRR BLK 1 SEC 30) and asked Perry Frazier to do the same. Perry Frazier will handle the request from the Planning side and needs to know his marketing counterpart. Earl Chanley asked Perry Frazier to let him know if marketing contacts Mr. Bradly.
