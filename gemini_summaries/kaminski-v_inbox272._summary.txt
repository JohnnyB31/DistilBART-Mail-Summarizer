Vince Kaminski is glad to attend the Market Forecasting Conference. Warren H. Winter invited Vince to speak at the conference and is attaching the preliminary agenda. Warren will consult with Vince to develop a speaking topic, and conference fees for Vince would be handled by EPIS. Warren looks forward to hearing from Vince.
