Barry attached curves for the JM Huber transaction, which is effectively completed. The 30,000/day capacity will sit until next week, and any curve shifts will be credited accordingly. Mike prefers to keep curves floating until the deal is booked and suggests agreeing on a sharing policy to avoid issues. They will meet early next week to finalize structures and booking.
