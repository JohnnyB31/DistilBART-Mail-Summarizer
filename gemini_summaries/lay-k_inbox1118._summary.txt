WWICORP has a proposal for a non-polluting energy solution that they believe could significantly reduce energy costs and make fossil fuels obsolete. They are offering to transfer US$20 Billion in assets and rights to Enron and propose a joint plan that could lead to a merger within six years. WWICORP would like to arrange a meeting to discuss this matter further.
