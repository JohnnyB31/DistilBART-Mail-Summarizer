John Crespo is preparing handouts for the Nov. 12 EEI Drafting Committee Meeting, which will include an agenda and other documents. He also provided parking instructions for attendees driving to the meeting. Andrew Katz has added "RTO Product Transition" to the agenda, which David Perlman would like to discuss. Ed will buy drinks on Monday night, but dinner won't happen. Attendees will need to get a guest parking pass.
