Dave Fuller will visit on 6/13 to discuss natural gas opportunities. Alan Meyer was informed by Ron Whitehead that Les Rawson arranged this, but Dave Fuller states he arranged it himself. Alan Meyer wants to continue working through John Malowney and hopes John will be available for the meeting or it can be rescheduled.
