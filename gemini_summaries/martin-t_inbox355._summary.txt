Lyne asks Mary if she is available this Saturday. Mary suggests having dinner on either 10/20 or 10/27 and will be house sitting for the next two weeks, but will be at Ken & Mary Ann's on those Saturdays. Mary also wants to do Halloween with them and may catch up with Tom downtown. Matthew wants to see Aunt Mary soon and Lyne invites Mary over for dinner.
