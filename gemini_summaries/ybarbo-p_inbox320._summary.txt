Dan Masters requests that a heel of LNG be left on board for the June 9th discharge, sufficient to reach the next loading in Qalhat on July 5th in load ready condition. Knut suggests a minimum heel of 3,200 m3, and if found necessary, they can reduce the number of tanks ready for loading to three, which should not delay them more than 4 hours. Dan approves the plan and asks Knut to plan accordingly.
