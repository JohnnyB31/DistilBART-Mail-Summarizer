ACC approved SWG rate order with amendments. Enron is directed to file new imbalance language within 30 days. SWG and Staff will review the filing for compliance. Enron is instructed to file a separate complaint for the 2000-2001 winter period. Staff vowed to try to get the Commission to reverse its position on reducing imbalance charges. Tom Mumaw told Andy Bettwy that if SWG and Staff acted in good faith, they would discuss the issue of last winter. Leslie Lawner will send out more details when she gets the order and will move on getting the complaint drafted ASAP.
