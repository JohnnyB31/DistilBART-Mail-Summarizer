Roseann explains the restructuring of the Electrobolt power project ownership chain, which is being done at OPIC's request to make it easier for OPIC to exercise remedies. The Americas tax team will also realize efficiencies. Consents have been obtained from construction lenders to finalize the restructuring before OPIC's involvement later this year. The attached slides show the steps. The top tier "Brazilian Power Development Trust" is a Delaware business trust with a 97/3 structure, where John Hancock is the equity and WestLB is the Lender Agent for the syndicated debt. This restructuring does not increase risks to Enron, lending banks, or equity. Roseann is available to answer further questions. Mary instructs to ignore the first email and use the provided one.
