Judy informs Ellen that Linder Oil confirmations for August and through October need to be GTC Firm confirmations with modified MDQ language. The pre-pay paperwork must be sent to the customer by August 10th, and Stacy Dickson needs the confirmations to finalize the contract. Ellen is asked to prepare these confirmations as soon as possible and to get with Gerald Nemec for questions about MDQ language. Ellen has not yet received meter information from Judy's group, but Judy clarifies that well information is not needed for the confirmation itself, only for tracking. Ellen also asks if wellhead/meter information is required.
