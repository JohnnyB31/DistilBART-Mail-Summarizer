The access request 000000000078904 for local admin rights has been rejected. EPNG has extended the suspension date of the old Passport system to January 6th, and IT is working with El Paso's IT department to resolve issues by this deadline. Beverly has administrative rights, allowing her to work from home without problems, while others on the team have experienced similar issues. Scott had previously advised IT in early November that the old Passport would be suspended.
