Kam updated Matt that new cash books are being set up ASAP and will be ready by tomorrow. Stephanie Sever will email new EOL IDs once the books are set up, but she is currently out of the office. Karen O'Day is handling the setup in Stephanie's absence and is working on it. Kam spoke with Karen yesterday.
