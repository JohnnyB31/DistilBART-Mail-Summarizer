Greg Piper is fighting for Enron's interests in NetCo issues and bids. A productive discussion occurred with bidders regarding technical issues and transition services, with a focus on IT assets and NetCo contract employees. A key issue is the IP ownership and licensing, with proposals restricting Enron's use of systems and applications. Greg seeks Tim Detmering's thoughts on these matters and will send another email with McMahon's response.
