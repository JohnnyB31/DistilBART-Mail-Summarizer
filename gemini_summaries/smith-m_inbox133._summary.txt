Phillip asked his team to coordinate listening to a weekly conference call. Jim forwarded an email regarding Western wholesale matters. An email provided the call details: Thursdays at 1:00 pm Pacific, 3:00 pm Central, and 4:00 pm Eastern time, with specific numbers and codes. A table of FERC issues was attached and available on the O drive. The proposed agenda included discussions on FERC market monitoring and gas subpoena responses. One participant will be unable to join the call due to attending a Senate Energy and Resource Committee Hearing. Tara from the fundamental group previously recorded these calls.
