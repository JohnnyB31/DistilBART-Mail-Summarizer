Wei is busy this morning and suggests a meeting at 1:30 PM. Susan will ask Tim and Michael about their availability and to email Wei and Chris Constantine to outline the information needed for curve mapping. Mike confirms 1:30 PM is fine and asks where they will sit. The required information includes gas curve relationships, volatility curve methodology, and volumetric position data for gas as of 11/30/01.
