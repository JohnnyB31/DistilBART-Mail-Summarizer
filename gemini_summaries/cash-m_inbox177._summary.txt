Elizabeth Hutchinson is running the Houston Marathon for the Leukemia Society and has raised $1000 towards her $2000 fundraising commitment. She is waiting for Enron's $1000 match, which she submitted before the cutoff deadline. The Leukemia Society has not yet received the match, and Elizabeth is personally responsible for the $1000 if Enron does not honor its commitment. She is asking Fran Mayes for information on when the funds will be sent. Kalen Pieper is also inquiring about whether the matches are being paid and if Elizabeth can be released from her commitment.
