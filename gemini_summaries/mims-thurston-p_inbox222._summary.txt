Jason Williams calculated Heartland Steel's mark-to-market exposure as $1,078,209 as of January 24, 2001. Valerie noted a net receivable of about $75,000 and asked if the contract termination fee should be included in the calculation. Valerie also noted an outstanding amount of approximately $92,177.09 owed to Heartland Steel for vol adjustments after January 24, 2001, which she suggests should be included in negotiations for a final number. Valerie will provide backup documentation for this credit.
