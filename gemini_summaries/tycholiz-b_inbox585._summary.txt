David Fildes shared a website with Jim Romeril, Paul Joslyn, and JBorle. He asked them to go to the website and type in 1031 in the sale number field, stating that 1031 is Haakan Loob. He also mentioned that he gave them the wrong lot number earlier and to type in 1032 for the "Great One." The price is about 25,000 Swedish kroners, which is about $5000 Canadian.
