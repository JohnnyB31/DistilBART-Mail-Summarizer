Team 1 decided to reconvene on Monday afternoon. Andy and Dave will work on a draft proposal and send it by the end of today. Dial-in instructions will follow on Monday. Bob suggests two edits to the proposal: "Receipt/Delivery Points" instead of "The Pipeline" and "Illustrative Toll" instead of "Toll".
