Kristen Hanson worked late and anticipates working late for the next two weeks, possibly until Christmas. She mentions her mom says Miss Dixie is doing fine and misses her. Jay Vandenberg confirmed he has a job and will see his daughter this weekend. Jay is asking Kristen if she knows Sarah Armstrong, who graduated from Trinity in 2000 and works at Exxon. Kristen knew Sarah Armstrong and provided her with test files for several classes, noting Sarah's good grades. Kristen looked at the Sigma website for identification. Kristen will see how her dog situation plays out and asks Jay to write back.
