Becky has a trip coming up next week and will be passing through IAH on Wednesday night around 9:00. She may be able to catch an earlier connection out of Denver and wants to know if Matt will be around to meet her at the airport for a drink. Matt lost $100,000 but says things are otherwise great and he could leave work anytime on Wednesday. Becky's schedule has no flexibility, and the best she can do is be in IAH by 7:55 with her flight to B'Ham at 9:55. They'd have to get dinner at the airport. Becky will call Matt on Wednesday and let him know what's happening.
