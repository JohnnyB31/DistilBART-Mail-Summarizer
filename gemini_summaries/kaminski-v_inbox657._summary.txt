Joe Hirl met with Niki Kiyoshi, who is looking for new opportunities as his current company is moving towards software development. Niki has a strong background in systems development, management, derivatives, and financial instruments, which could be a good fit for Enron, particularly in supporting Asian activities or within Vince Kaminski's research group. Niki has revised his resume and attached a list of publications, and will await feedback from Joe regarding potential placement within Enron. Joe told Niki he would pass his CV along to Vince and asked Vince to contact Niki if he sees a possibility. Joe also asked Vince if he had a chance to get with Niki and if he found him interesting.
