Carol Carter sent an updated origination schedule for 3rd quarter to Barry Tycholiz. Tycholiz reviewed it and asked Mark Whitt to review it for his team and advise of any variance by Wednesday, October 31. Whitt agreed it looked reasonable and would like to add to the Q4 totals. Carter will consolidate originations for all teams and submit to Louise.
