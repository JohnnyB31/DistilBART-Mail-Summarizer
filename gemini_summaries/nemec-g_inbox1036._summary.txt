Stacey provided an update on Holcomb Oil and Gas Inc./Key Gas Holding, LLC and mentioned a link to a new counterparty request form. She spoke with Susan Herrera at Holcomb, who did not seem to understand the request for an assignment letter, so Stacey gave her Gerald's number. Stacey will request the Global Counterparty group to set up the CP once a good assignment is received, and Sharon will process it. Stacey will keep everyone informed. Stacey does not have access to change the counterparty on the deal, so her group will not be able to attach a contract until the counterparty is there.
