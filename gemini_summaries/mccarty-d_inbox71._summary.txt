Mike Harrelson provided a cost breakdown for TFT flat panels from Corp., totaling $12,250.00 for the first request and $4,200.00 for the second. He mentioned that GSS is still determining the cost of plasma panels and will provide that information soon. Mike also noted that they are awaiting court approval to officially sell the panels but can "loan" them in the interim, with the cost to be settled later. Steve Hotte forwarded this information to Danny McCarty as an FYI. Rod Hayslett inquired if the costs were within the budget.
