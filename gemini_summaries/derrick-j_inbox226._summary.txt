Renata sent documents for the Supervisory Board Meeting on 2001-11-20. Jarek pointed out that Resolutions No. 4, 6, and 9 are incorrect, stating the Supervisory Board did not review or approve the new budget changes and that the vote descriptions are incorrect. Jarek believes the draft budget must be reviewed again at the next meeting.
