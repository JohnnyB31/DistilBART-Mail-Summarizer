Peter needs to confirm if Enron transacts physical gas with Morgan Stanley (MS) and if their Master or Canadianized GISB Ts and Cs can be used. Jeff Hodge has been sent draft GISB and special provisions for Enron North America Corp. and Enron Canada Corp. by Daniel Garcia and requested to forward the Canadian drafts to Calgary. Jeff needs to call Peter regarding this.
