Cris Sherman is looking for an example contract for a pipeline interconnect/meter construction project. Hugh Connett of Bridgeline is facilitating the deal where Bridgeline will be reimbursed for costs, and they will retain ownership of the asset. Cris was told Barbara Gray may be able to help. Gerald Nemec may also provide an example.
