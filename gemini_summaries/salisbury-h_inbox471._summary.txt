Holden was informed by Mike that SRP is reporting deal 805316 as not found for 9/12. Mike asks Holden to investigate. Holden states the deal was done by Mark and Janice at SRP and that he heard Mark make the call. Holden also asks Mike if he has other avenues with PAC tranny, as he is not in a position to negotiate.
