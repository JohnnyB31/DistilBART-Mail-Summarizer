Maria sent Bill comments on his draft answer and suggested a conference call tomorrow morning. She also mentioned that Greg has additional thoughts on the contract capacity, and Kathy R. checked that IS has not filed a protest. Bill asked for a good time for a call, and Mary Kay suggested 9:30 or 10:00. Greg then proposed 10:00.
