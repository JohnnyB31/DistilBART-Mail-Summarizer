Shona Wilson sent an updated version of a template to multiple recipients, including Kam Keiser, Kevin Sweeney, and others. The template is for terminated vs. non-terminated deals and should be as of today's positions. Shona expects it to be doable by the end of next week. She also requested Form B for all commodities from the recipients by 1/31/02, including a reconciliation to their rolls, for E&Y. Kam Keiser asked if this needs to exclude intercompany deals.
