Yaqoob Al-Zadjali apologizes for missing an opportunity due to a time difference. He proposes attendees from Oman LNG for a meeting in Houston, including Mr. Hiro Sakaguchi and possibly Mr. Harib Al-Kitani. Yaqoob will confirm the exact timing soon. Paul Y'Barbo is flexible on dates for a June meeting and asks for convenient dates from Oman LNG and who will attend. Paul will speak to Clay regarding an agenda and asks Yaqoob to call his mobile.
