Ernesto Blanco confirms that Accroven Commercial Operations start date was July 09, 2001. Pam Butler requests an updated NPV calculation, reviewed by RAC, to determine potential additional payments for the Compensation Committee. Norm Spalding has supplied December financials, and Pam is asking Rick Buy who in RAC is available to review them. Ernesto explains the process will involve sign-offs from RAC, Jim Hughes, Stan Horton, the Compensation Committee, and possibly the Creditor Committee and E&Y.
