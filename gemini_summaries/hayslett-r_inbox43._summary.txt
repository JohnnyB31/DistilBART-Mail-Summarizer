Phil Lowry believes the expense should remain in corporate allocation. Mike Nelson questions if direct expenses for corporate assistance are always paid, and Morris Brassfield is inquiring about the policy for direct charges for corporate assistance and if an agreement was made with Brindle for Kyle's expenses, and if Dave Odneal or Mike requested the travel.
