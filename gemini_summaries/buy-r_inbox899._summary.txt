Kristin Stathis is forwarding a draft PGE limits document and an attached email to Stan Horton. Rick Buy was inadvertently left off the cc list, and Peggy Fowler and Jim Lobdell want him to see the draft. Italicized items in the draft require Rick's approval. The document was discussed at PGE's Sept. 6th Risk Management Committee meeting and is being sent before Stan Horton's Monday conference call.
