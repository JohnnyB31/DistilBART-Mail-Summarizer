Inja Chun is asking for direction on whether to include Enfiber and Sabor Settlement systems in the EBS sale package, as they contain proprietary technology and Sabor is not yet complete. Everett Plante recommends these systems not be included due to their competitive advantage and Sabor's incomplete status. Ed Smida forwarded Chun's email to Plante for his thoughts.
