Ed attached settlement documents for a delay in start-up claim, which he negotiated for 9 months. He advises accepting $750k, an 83% success, as it's unlikely to get more due to circumstances and counsel advice. Ed wants to finalize by Wednesday, his last week. Jarek agrees with the proposal. Sophie needs to confirm the wording of the acceptance notice. Alf asked Ed to let him know ASAP if there are any problems and believes the figures are correct.
