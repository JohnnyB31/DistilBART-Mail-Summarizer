EES needs to send a letter to the PUCT demonstrating they have tested their systems with ERCOT ISO by 12/28/01. Jason needs to get this letter or a copy from CSC or ERCOT ISO and forward it to Bob Frank and Jim Steffes. Jason is also trying to confirm if Nancy Hetrick is still with the company as she may have received official communication.
