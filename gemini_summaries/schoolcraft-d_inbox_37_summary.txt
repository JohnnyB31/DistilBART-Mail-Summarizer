Gary received a call from Jeff Greider at Bloomfield regarding pressure loss between El Paso Blanco and La Plata. Jeff measured pressures and found a 3 psi loss across the scrubber, 4-5 psi across the T strainer, and 4 psi across the straightening vanes. Gary asked Jeff to inspect the T strainer screen and straightening vanes, suggesting the possibility of getting a spare gasket and basket. Gary will check with the manufacturer about available parts and may consider replacing the existing screen with a larger mesh. For pipeline tuning, it is recommended to use the El Paso Blanco pressure at the El Paso interconnect rather than the Bloomfield suction pressure.
