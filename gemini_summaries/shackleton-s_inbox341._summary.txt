Sheila has drafted a proposed letter to authorize withdrawals from the Enron Corp Account at MSDW. Ben Glisan and Tim Despain were previously authorized by Andy Fastow in June to withdraw funds. MSDW will accept a letter on company letterhead for authorization. Sheila can draft this letter and have Andy sign it, including Ben and Tim for examples. This would be an alternative to the Corporate Secretary route, as sole reliance on Andy is not ideal. Sheila asks for advice on proceeding with this letter and requests comments on her proposal.
