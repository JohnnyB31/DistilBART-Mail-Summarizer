Carol attached a revised origination schedule for 3rd quarter and supporting detail. Barry has reviewed the file and believes it is accurate up to the end of Q3. Carol asked Barry to provide any revisions by Wednesday, October 31, so she can consolidate the originations for all teams and submit them to Louise.
