Questar Corp. is canceling the California portion of the Southern Trails Pipeline conversion due to state regulations, making it uneconomic. The east-of-California portion will open June 1 next year. Questar is looking for alternative uses or a buyer for the California section. The ability of supplies to reach California depends on border takeaway capacity. Mike McGowan is inquiring about conversion costs and Questar's plans.
