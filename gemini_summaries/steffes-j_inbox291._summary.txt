James Shurskis needs to discuss bonding issues with Harry Kingerski, as the current wording requirements for Enron's electric licenses are not met. Updates are needed for priority of claims, bond cancellation time, and claim period. Shurskis will email an example of standard bond language. Enron Energy Services had revenues of $38,704,087 in 2000, requiring a new bond of $3,870,409, while Enron Power Marketing's $250,000 bond remains satisfactory. Gloria will compare the new wording to current wording, and Harry will inquire about 2001 revenue expectations to potentially negotiate a lower bond.
