Russ Severson needs a list of people for Netco Sitara access in the East and Central Regions, as the Estate access will be the same as Production, but Netco access will have to be set up from scratch. Kam Keiser wants everyone in risk to have access to all regions, while traders should only have access to their own. Russ is interested in what people are in each function group for Netco, and has received information on each group except Central. The plan is to have a large mass set up, with additional updates handled under eRequest. Russ asks for a list of people who should have access to Netco, including Risk, Logistics, Trading, and anyone else, for West, East, Central, and Texas regions.
