John Kinser attached a detailed list of MHEB procedures and ideas for the hourly crew. Don Baughman requested the 24 Hour Group read and familiarize themselves with the attached Word document procedures and attempt to maximize their relationship with MHEB by moving as many MW as possible. Power is now available due to the end of August contracts. Kinser will answer any questions.
