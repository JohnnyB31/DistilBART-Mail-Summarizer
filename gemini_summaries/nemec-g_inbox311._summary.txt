Lisa sent Gerald the Unocal Term Sheet for review. Gerald identified a potential issue with the transport piece of the proposal, stating ENA cannot simply sell NNG capacity to Unocal without Unocal contracting directly or ENA doing a "Capacity Release." Chris and Ned are meeting with Unocal early this afternoon to discuss the project and term sheet. Lisa attached the latest version of the Term Sheet with changes in blue for Gerald's review.
