Steve Van Hooser is forwarding an email to Jeff Speirs, a bankruptcy attorney, who will assist with rejecting out-of-the-money gas transportation contracts. Steve needs full company names, contact persons, and addresses to notify the pipes of the motion to reject, asking recipients to gather this information soon after New Years. Steve also contacted Jeff Speirs separately, identifying himself as an Enron attorney advising on ENA gas transportation matters, with Elizabeth Sager's suggestion to prepare a Motion to Reject executory transportation service agreements. A spreadsheet details the contracts, with ENA wishing to assume five and reject the rest. Steve requests Jeff to review the spreadsheet and provide feedback, also noting his own questions about agency relationships and ENA's right to reject agreements where capacity has been released. Steve looks forward to discussing these matters and the timeframe for rejection.
