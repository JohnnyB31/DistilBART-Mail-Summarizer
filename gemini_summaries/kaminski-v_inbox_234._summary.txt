Diane notified Vince that EGM wants to charge his cost center for using Avistar, a weather research system. The total cost will be $10,583 over 3 years, which is not significant. Diane is seeking Vince's approval. Vince asked Mike if it sounds right, and Mike forwarded the inquiry to Kevin. Kevin spoke with Paige Cox, who confirmed the price is correct and provided her extension if more information is needed.
