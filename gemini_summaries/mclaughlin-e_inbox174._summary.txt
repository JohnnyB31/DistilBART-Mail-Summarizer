Kam Keiser was able to create a Netco file for each region. Kam will save the new P&L to each region and asks recipients to pick a P&L from their region as a backup. Phillip Love suggests adding Jad/Couch's position report file as a backup and asks Greg Couch to put the query file for the price desk. Kam inquires if anyone has additional files.
