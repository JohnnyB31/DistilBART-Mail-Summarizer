Chip Schneider informs Louise Kitchen that terminating equipment for the Longview project by 10/31/01 will result in a $23 million write-off plus $3 million in development costs. Extending orders to 11/30/01 will cost an additional $5.3 million, and extending to 12/31/01 will cost an additional $8.7 million. Termination before year-end offers no significant recovery potential.
