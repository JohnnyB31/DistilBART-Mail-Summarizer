Maggie Matheson is investigating POI 78161, which appears in TMS Model Office but not production. Linda Trevino states POI 78161 has been invalid since 8/1/2001. Ramona Betancourt adds POI 500620 is active on TW but not Burlington's side, and POI 78161 and 500168 are the same point, so 78161 should be made invalid for transport. Linda Trevino confirms POI 500631 is active and valid in San Juan Basin and will remain in its current groups until facility planning advises otherwise.
