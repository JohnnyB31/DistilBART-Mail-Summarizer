Morgan Stanley has exposures to Enron Gas Liquids, Inc. and Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp. and would like to enter into netting agreements. Morgan Stanley has already executed a netting agreement with Enron Capital & Trade Resources Ltd. and is providing proposed netting agreements for the other two entities, based on the UK entity's form. John Viverito is forwarding these draft agreements to Sara Shackleton, and Tom Moran, head of EGM credit, wants to get Morgan Stanley comfortable ASAP. Comments on the proposed agreements are requested by Monday.
