Bobbi is asking Alice and Charles for their opinion on revising INS forms for the Enron annual report due to adjustments in Gross and Net Annual Income figures. Alice spoke with Margaret and suggested amending the INS forms while continuing to use the current annual report. Bobbi has forwarded Alice's response to Michelle and Lizzette for confirmation.
