Marie Heard contacted Greg Johnston at Mary Cook's request to locate documents for two prepay transactions: one on December 13, 1999, and another in December 2000. Greg believes Enron Canada was not involved in these deals and only recalls the Alberta Prepay dated September 28, 2000, which was retired on September 28, 2001. Greg has checked and confirmed this information with Peter, and Tana reportedly has documentation for the Alberta Prepay. Greg does not have documentation for the two deals Marie inquired about.
