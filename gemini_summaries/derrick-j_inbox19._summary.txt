Andrew Rogers QC called from Jakarta and reached an agreement with Quentin Loh SC that Lord Mustill will be appointed as the presiding arbitrator for the 3 arbitrations. A letter confirming his acceptance will come from Lord Mustill's Clerk, probably appearing from London tomorrow. The next round of conversations by Andrew Roger QC will be with Mr Justice Pendse. Christopher Walker attached Lord Mustill's curriculum vitae and asked Gail to circulate it.
