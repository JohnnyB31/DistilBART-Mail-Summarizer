Dan Fancler sent a summary and schedules indicating EPPI owes Oneok/GPM $339,158.69 and Oneok owes NNG $92,774.99. NNG is billing fuel retention on out-of-balance deliveries. Tracy Geaccone needs to understand the 4.45% and what can be done to control it, asking for help. Dan is turning over the resolution of differences to NNG marketing and cash payment to Tracy Geaccone and/or Jennifer Lev as Oneok is pushing hard for the money. Dan also asked Mike and Steve to confirm his calculations and set a meeting with Logistics, Regulatory and Tracy Geaccone.
