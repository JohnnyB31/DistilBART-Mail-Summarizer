Teresa Carroll-Childers informs Jeff Dasovich that CSC needs 810 EDI files from CA utilities to invoice power customers. Utilities have stopped sending 810s and are only providing 867s. If 810s are not received, information from attached spreadsheets must be provided. Enron has been unable to invoice these customers since December 5, resulting in significant revenue loss. Teresa will be on vacation after 11:30 AM central today, and Maggie Brown will be her backup.
