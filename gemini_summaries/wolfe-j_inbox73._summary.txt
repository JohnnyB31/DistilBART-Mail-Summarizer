Mom invited Beth and Jay to a camping trip in Austin from July 26-28, including a train ride to Burnett for shopping. Beth is getting her car fixed. Beth provided her Houston address for a Nextel bill and asked Mom to either pay it or mail it to her. Mom has already paid for the trip and is offering to change the address for a phone if Beth wants to keep it.
