Mark Lavine attached the Red Rock weekly report. Lorraine Lindberg noted a delayed in-service schedule for Red Rock Stations 1/2 (June 15, 2002) and Station 3 (July 1, 2002), and questioned whether to inform shippers and utilize existing space for the Oneok deal to avoid revenue loss. Robert Kilmer suggested discussing this at TW's meeting.
