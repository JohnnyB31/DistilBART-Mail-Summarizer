Scott Manuel informs Jim Fallon that the Kenneth J. Rice mentioned in a news article was not the former Enron Executive, but rather someone from SynerG. A media outlet (totaltele.com) incorrectly identified him. Frank and Ruth Lancaster discovered this error during a D&B/Lexus search. Scott forwards this information as previously requested.
