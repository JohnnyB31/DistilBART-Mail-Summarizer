Kam sent the gas DPR to Chris and Shona, which will be sent on Wednesdays and Mondays. Chris asked for clarification on the (7,849) BCF representation and P&L numbers for columns Q through T, and also questioned if they have become shorter. Kam stated that they do not need East/West for gas and will fill in those columns for tomorrow's report. Chris requested Kam to email the sheet for now and will set up another export process later, while also asking if Canada Gas has done their part. Kam questioned if Chris will send a new form or if Kam should make changes, and if he wants a daily email or a file for saving.
