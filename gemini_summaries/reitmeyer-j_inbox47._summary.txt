Kim reports that reporting has been migrated to a new server and the old server has been disabled. All reports have been generated and analysts' PCs have been verified. The cause of a problem is not yet known, but Kim will be looking into it and will communicate a plan to ensure reporting is safe tomorrow morning. Kim will be targeting known users, specifically Justin's group and Jay, tomorrow.
