Leslie Hansen is working on the Master Netting Agreement with Reliant. She needs a list of Reliant entities and contracts, state of incorporation, chief executive office, credit terms, and existing guaranties. Leslie will not be in the office on Wednesday but needs copies of all Reliant documents for Thursday morning. Leslie also requested Marie to email a draft of the Collateral Annex to Dede Russo at Reliant by the end of today, noting that Leslie is working to customize credit terms for Reliant. Jay Williams will work with Leslie on the agreement and send her a list of Reliant entities and trading contracts. Martha Keesler is available to assist with pulling contracts from LiveLink.
