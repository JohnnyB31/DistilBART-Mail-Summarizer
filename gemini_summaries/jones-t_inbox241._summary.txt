Bob Shults is finalizing a Broker Client deal with Norwegian Energy and First Energy, giving them access to various European energy markets and Brent Crude. He is seeking confirmation from Lara McKinney on the appropriate exhibit for this transaction. Mark Greenberg has also inquired with Bob Shults about whether APB Energy Europe has a different name or if additional deals are being made, and has asked Tana Jones to confirm the appropriate name with Bob and verify collateral coverage. Bob Shults needs to verify with Joe what the name should be, as they acquired these firms.
