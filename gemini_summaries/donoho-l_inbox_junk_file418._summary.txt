Lindy has sent a draft announcement about SoCal/Topock scheduling to a group of recipients, including Ramona. Ramona is clarifying confirmation processes and asks if SoCal will confirm the Topock point via EDI and if they will provide a confirmation window. Ramona also notes that Socal Needles point 10487 is currently set up as passive for confirmation and the Topock point would need the same status if confirmed via EDI. SoCal will need to complete an Operator Choice request form. Lindy is incorporating comments from a meeting on Friday and will then run the draft past SoCal. This change stems from a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.
