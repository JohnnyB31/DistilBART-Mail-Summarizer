Dan Dietrich is working to resolve issues with the All Employee Meeting viewing. He will meet with IT teams to create an action plan. Dan will communicate when the replay will be available for viewing and asks interested employees to email him directly, not reply all. The Internal Communications department has not yet released the original video and has no ETA.
