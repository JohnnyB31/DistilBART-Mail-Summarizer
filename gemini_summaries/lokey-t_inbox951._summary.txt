Stan wants to start thinking about assumptions for the 2004 rate case and a ten-year plan. John Keiser will bring the 2002 Plan, but Rod does not want him to hand out anything. John would like to review assumptions with Teb and Blair. Teb asked if they were meeting today to discuss the meeting with Stan. Robert Hayes is out on Wednesday, and Teb may need to call him.
