AT&T may suspend Enron corporate cell phone accounts starting Friday, 12/7, and all remaining Portland accounts will be terminated by 12/11. Users can convert their phones to personal accounts with Susan Nothnagel on 12/7 from 1-4 PM, and AT&T will waive the activation fee. Management approved cell phones are eligible for reimbursement based on business need; employees should see their managers. Steve asks if he and Christian will be reimbursed for cell phone expenses.
