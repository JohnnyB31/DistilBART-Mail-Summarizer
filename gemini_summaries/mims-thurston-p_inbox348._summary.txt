Andy Edling from Kinder Morgan notifies Sylvia Pollan that NSS Storage Contract #114846 expires on 6/2/2002 and Enron needs to notify them by 12/5/01 for the ROFR process. A revised letter with a 12/31/01 notification date was faxed in error and should be disregarded; the original date of 12/5/01 stands. Sylvia will forward the ROFR form from Andy to L. Mims and Bryant Frihart.
