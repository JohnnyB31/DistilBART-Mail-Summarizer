Joel attached a draft Purchase Agreement for the Raptor unwind, with similar agreements for other Raptor structures. The plan is to dissolve most Raptor entities the day after the LJM buyout, before the end of the quarter, except for those involved in Raptor 3. Mary asked Joel and Gordon for a call regarding Enron Corp EITF 0019 swaps, as she has no executed versions and needs to know if they are to be terminated and if they want her to prepare the termination. Mark Spradling attached clean and redlined versions of the Purchase Agreement.
