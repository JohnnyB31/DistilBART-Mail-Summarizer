David Roensch is requesting an update on San Juan Lateral efficiencies to estimate O&M budget impacts. Ben Asante reports that Ignacio line efficiencies are low, and there's a 2-3% decrease on the Bloomfield to Gallup segment since last spring. Ben suggests pigging and re-applying the Bloomfield-Gallup section in April, and installing the launcher and receiver for the Ignacio line in the fall. David requests Darryl and Gallup make arrangements to dry pig the lateral and to take another look before reapplying DRA. He also asks Ben to provide estimated volumes to Jerry for scheduling. A conference call will be set up after dry pigging.
