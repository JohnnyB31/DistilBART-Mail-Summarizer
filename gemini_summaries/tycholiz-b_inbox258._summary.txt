Diane McVicker is providing an update on the EPNG meetings that took place from September 11-13. Some parties met in Phoenix to brainstorm, and Diane is sharing the discussions. They discussed settlement possibilities and capacity allocation. Greg Lander will run numbers for the EOC, and SRP will reschedule settlement discussions once Greg's analysis is complete, likely in late September or via a conference call.
