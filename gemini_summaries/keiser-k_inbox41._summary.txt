Doug Nelson asked Kay Classen if deals #1192611 & #1193243 should be with PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation. Kay thinks Cora or Cam fixed it last month, as she stopped using them after messing up in December. Doug then forwarded this to Cora Pendergrass and Kam Keiser, asking them to make the change in SITARA if possible.
