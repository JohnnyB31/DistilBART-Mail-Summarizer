Eric Gadd sent Danny McCarty a summary of his discussion with Dennis McConaghy regarding ANNGTC. Dennis was unhappy with the liability issues and the proposed GP role. Enron is prepared to exchange residual claims for AFUDC and interest accruals for a 9.4% GP stake. Enron wants the partnership to recover historic capital contributions and recognizes AFUDC and interest accruals are sunk. If Enron does not rejoin as a GP, they will walk away from AFUDC and interest accruals but want reimbursement for historic capital contribution. Enron is not comfortable making a collective response to Sen. Murkowski and will make their own. Danny asked if he should call Dennis or if Dennis will call him, and if Dennis is satisfied with the current situation. Eric is not worried about his relationship with Dennis but is conscious that Stan is developing a relationship with Kvisle. They have no reason for changing their position on making no collective response to Sen. Murkowski during the telecon with Dennis at 5pm. Dennis believes Enron's name is essential and that a passive attitude with politicians will not serve their interests.
