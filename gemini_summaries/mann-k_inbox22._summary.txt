Ruth informed Julie Smith that ENEL will submit the open season response and sign Tennessee's PA for the South Texas Expansion. The deadline to submit a response is this afternoon at 5:00 pm, with a binding agreement by tomorrow afternoon (Thursday, November 29th). The Rio Bravo Pipeline Open Season has been extended to December 7, 2001, giving ENEL more time for their proposal. Ruth spoke with Tennessee Gas Pipeline and indicated that another international company has submitted an Open Season response, suggesting ENEL has submitted the necessary paperwork.
