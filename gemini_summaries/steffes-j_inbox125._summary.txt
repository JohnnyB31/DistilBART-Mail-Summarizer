FERC deliberated and approved two agenda items: modifying the June 19 Price Mitigation Order to set the price cap at $108 until April 30, 2002, and decoupling it from California's reserve deficiency to tie it to the price of natural gas. They also denied rehearing requests for California Orders since December 15, 2000, and ordered the California ISO to submit revised congestion management and day-ahead market plans by May 1, 2002. Both orders passed with 3 yeas and 1 nay.
