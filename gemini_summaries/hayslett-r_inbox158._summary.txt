George is awaiting an update regarding an extension for Northern Border Partners Common Units, with a decision expected by the second week of December. George proposes selling the units to pay down debt, even if proceeds are trapped, and agrees with withholding public announcements until a clearer understanding of the situation is reached to protect their bargaining position. Kevin mentioned to Stan and Rod that they should proceed with this plan.
