Jim Steffes received a call from the CPUC regarding an unauthorized service switch by Pac Tel. Jim needs to call back by Monday EOB and asked Lamar to identify the Pac Tel client rep. Jim will be out on vacation next week, so he asked Lamar to let Jeff Dasovich know. Geoff Pollard is the SM for Pac Tel and will keep them posted. Geoff placed a call to the customer but has not heard back yet.
