Susan requested Bernice to set up a book and notify upon completion. Susan will be out of office Dec 20-21, so Francis and Cecilia should handle the ERMS side. Susan has already set up the books in RiskTRAC. M. Love noted that the books were added as a tab and changed to GJ/CAD, which has been fixed.
