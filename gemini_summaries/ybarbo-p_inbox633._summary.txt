Barbara Whittaker informed Lorraine Lindberg and Paul Y'Barbo that PNM's October invoice is incorrect. She believes the commodity charge needs to be corrected and has asked her accounting team to discuss it with Laura Giambrone. Barbara requests their help in setting up the invoice correctly. Lorraine had previously asked a Market Services rep about crediting the commodity on PNM's bill.
