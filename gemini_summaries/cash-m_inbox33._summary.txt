Aaron Brown confirms to Michelle Cash that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Enron must approve all formations of and grants related to subsidiary or phantom equity plans. Mary will work closely with Aaron and is responsible for presenting the plan for approval after all interests are scrubbed. It is very important that no promises are made before Compensation Committee approval. Michelle asks if this applies to companies where Enron has a large ownership interest but that may not be a "subsidiary".
