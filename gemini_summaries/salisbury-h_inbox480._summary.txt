Fran informed Tom, Mark, Holden, and Matt that Risk has changed the mapping of WestWing 230KV and WestWing 500KV deals to be valued against the WestWing curve. The P&L issue observed on 10/5/01 has been corrected on 10/8/01. Fran had previously explained to Zhiyun and Norman that due to legal reasons, deals with a delivery point of WestWing were being changed to WestWing 230KV or WestWing 500KV. This change caused deals to be valued against the WSCC-S curve instead of the WestWing curve, resulting in an unfavorable curve shift and a loss of $294K on deal#802862.1. Fran requested a change in PortCalc's mapping to ensure deals with WestWing 230KV or WestWing 500KV delivery points are still valued against the WestWing curve. Fran also inquired about the timeline for this change.
