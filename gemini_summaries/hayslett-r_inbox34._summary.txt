Tracy is organizing a presentation run-through for the Lay reviews on November 1 in EB 49C2. John is attending, but may change plans due to being scheduled in Korea. John previously submitted approximately $2 million for his group's budget and $300,000 for Gina Taylor's group. Tracy is forwarding the meeting invitation to Rod and Kevin. Tracy also asks attendees to send presentations ahead of time if calling in and encourages inviting others.
