Vince sent John a resume for Claude Philoche, who he met a few years ago and was impressed by. John would love to talk to Claude, asking if he lives in France and if it's easier for him to work in London, offering to arrange a phone interview if not. Vince stated Claude travels periodically to Houston and offered to inquire about his next trip, or arrange a phone interview or invite him to Houston if John wants to speak to him urgently.
