Duke Energy International has attached a non-binding offer letter for Enron's Maranzana Power Plant and is interested in discussing the purchase of Enron's gas and power books, trading floor, and associated assets. Enron needs to conduct further due diligence and would like to start that process soon, and enter into an exclusivity agreement for valuation. Fede is concerned the indication for the MMPP asset is low and would like to discuss their position and action plan.
