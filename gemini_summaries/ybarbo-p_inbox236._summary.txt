Paul Y'Barbo is coordinating a meeting with Oman LNG representatives between June 7-15, and they are interested in visiting CMS Terminal and possibly the Hoegh Galleon unloading. Jonathan Whitehead's availability is uncertain due to a planned trip to Europe but he will know in a few days. The second week of July also works for Oman LNG, with potential topics including Dabhol updates, implementation procedures, CMS Terminal visits, and spot cargoes. Attendees are asked to advise their availability and suggest other meeting topics.
