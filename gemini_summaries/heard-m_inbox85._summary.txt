Robbi Rossi is working on Marie Heard's orders and received pricing from Schumacher and Kravet, which is half of what Marie was quoted. Robbi is checking with her husband about adding taxes, as she is using his tax resale certificate. She will let Marie know the exact amount including freight and taxes. Robbi has also filled out the application for Robert Allen and aims to have it done by Friday, but needs banking information from her husband. Meanwhile, there are rumors of people being given packages and others being told no about returning to Houston, with some on emergency projects and concerns of big trouble.
