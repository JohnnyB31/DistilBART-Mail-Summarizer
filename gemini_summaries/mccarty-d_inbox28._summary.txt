Julie Armstrong is following up on the TV monitor, which is still not functioning. Joan advised someone was to check it on Thursday, but Julie did not see them before she departed at 5:20. Julie was out of office on Friday and is unsure of any activity. She wants to resolve the issue in a timely manner and asks for an update. She also questions if the cable is functioning.
