Duke Energy will acquire the New Albany facility from Enron. Kevin Presto will control dispatch and premium. The plant must be ready for potential premiums until the transfer to Duke Energy, which is expected in early October 2001. All inquiries from non-Enron sources should be directed to Lloyd Will.
