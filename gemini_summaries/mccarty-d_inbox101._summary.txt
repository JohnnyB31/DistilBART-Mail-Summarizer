Rod Hayslett and Denis Tu forwarded an FYI email from CERA titled "Radical Shift in Western Power and Gas Market Dynamics - CERA Monthly Briefing." The briefing discusses a downturn in western power and gas markets due to increased plant additions and declining demand, predicting this trend will continue for several years. It also mentions CERAWeek in February 2002 with an early bird registration discount until November 30th.
