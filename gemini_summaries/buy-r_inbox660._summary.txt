Kevin Garland's group has completed their new investment strategy and are preparing to move into execution. Kevin wants to present the strategy to Rick Buy, Dave Gorte, and Randy Peterson for feedback. Rick is out recovering from an illness and won't be back until after Labor Day, but suggests Kevin can proceed with Dave and Randy or wait until he returns. Kevin agrees to wait for Rick's return and will have his assistant schedule a presentation. Rebekah is asked to check with Rick's assistant to schedule the presentation upon his return.
