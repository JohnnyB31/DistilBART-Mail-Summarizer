Kevin met with Jayshree Desai to discuss changes to the NNG valuation model. Jayshree will make and circulate the model today. Kevin has several questions regarding capex assumptions, O&M, contract rolloff scenarios, equity infusion, and the MCTJ loan. Bob Chandler is concerned about deferred taxes and how NNG will pay them. They are trying to send out an information memo by the end of the week, and the model will be the basis for NNG valuation. They can discuss rate case assumptions and expansion opportunities tomorrow.
