Kevin asked James to roll expansions into Rod's project model and Michael Ratner to link them into the TW financial model. Kevin attached the contract roll-off information and needs Lindy's assistance to develop an average rate by segment, while Rod will circulate an expansion model. Davis attached a template to summarize the capacity roll-off issue and filled in example numbers. Davis will incorporate Lindy's filled data into the TW model. Tracy is asked to call Kevin.
