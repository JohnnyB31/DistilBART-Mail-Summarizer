Mansoor is sending engineering standards to Eric who is forwarding them to Agave ASAP. Earl will email David the Engineering Standards when the Enron internet is running again. Jim Williams will be there this afternoon and Earl will give him a typical I/C package drawing and material list. The I/C is a 10" UltraSonic meter.
