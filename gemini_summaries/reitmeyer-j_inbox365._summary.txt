Kelly Lombardi has set up the rate server handle #27470 for PSCO.CITYGATE.GDP.D.A. George/Russ need to bounce the servers and notify Frank to attach the deal. Carole needs to send Cecilia/Margie and Kelly the new pub_code, and then the rate handle will need to be attached to the deal in Sitara. Cecilia/Margie need to map the pubcode in ERMS.
