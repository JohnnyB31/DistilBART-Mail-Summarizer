Lisa received a fax from Joe Halprin regarding UCC filings. Robert returned from a meeting and learned that Marc Manly's team had a good meeting with Gene Lockhart and are preparing a document. Marc Manly will email a blacklined version of the document within an hour and requested a conference call afterward to discuss the changes, not to negotiate. Marc explained that some changes were made for practical reasons, such as the daily reporting requirement in Section 2(b). Robert will provide further updates.
