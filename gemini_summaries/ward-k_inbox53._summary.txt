Kim is back in the office and will have a conference call this afternoon to iron out calculation questions. Mara Bronstein will provide a final spreadsheet. Darla is following up with Anne Bike regarding Citizens info, specifically payment to John Cogan and the EAMR payment. Darla also asks if Anne talked to Sarabeth about it. Kim is not sure if Sarabeth was spoken to about the invoice and asks Darla if she has talked to Bryce about it.
