Irma Alvarez provides an update on Tom Martin's ESOP change request, confirming receipt but noting a blackout period until November 20th due to vendor changes. She apologizes for an error in processing the form, which was sent to the incorrect resource. Laura Vuittonet requests notification once Tom Martin's ESOP changes information is received and asks if Tom needs to inquire directly about it. Irma will provide an update to Laura after the blackout period.
