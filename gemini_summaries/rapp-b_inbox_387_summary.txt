Bill Rapp is handling compliance for Northern Natural Gas and an issue has arisen due to personnel changes at Enron Corp. Andy Fastow needs to be replaced as "President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division". Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson as a replacement. Bill is asking for Mary Kay and Joe's thoughts on this suggestion. Bill will need help contacting Jeff McMahon. Greg has no objection and asks if Drew wants to contact McMahon's office.
